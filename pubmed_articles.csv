8515237,Diketocamphane enantiomer-specific 'Baeyer-Villiger' monooxygenases from camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453.,Journal of general microbiology,"Jones KH, Smith RT, Trudgill PW","Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 grew with either (+)- or (-)-camphor as sole carbon source. Enantiomer-specific 'biological Baeyer-Villiger' monooxygenases were synthesized irrespective of the camphor isomer used for growth. The two enzymes are probably the products of separate genes but showed many similarities. Each consisted of two electrophoretically identical subunits, bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) non-covalently and accepted electrons from an induced NADH dehydrogenase which interacted with the FMN bound to the oxygenating component. They showed minor differences in M(r) with 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase being the smaller enzyme. Isoelectric focussing showed the two enzymes to have different acidic pI values. Polyclonal antibodies raised against 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase also cross-reacted with 2,5-diketocamphane 1,2-monooxygenase and its subunits.",10.1099/00221287-139-4-797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8515237,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/00221287-139-4-797,(+)-Camphor,
6848481,"Camphor revisited: involvement of a unique monooxygenase in metabolism of 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid by Pseudomonas putida.",Journal of bacteriology,"Ougham HJ, Taylor DG, Trudgill PW","Previously, Pseudomonas putida was shown to degrade (+)-camphor, and cleavage of the first ring of the bicyclic structure involved two monooxygenases (a hydroxylase and a ring oxygen-inserting enzyme), a dehydrogenase, and spontaneous cleavage of an unstable oxygenation product (lactone). Cleavage of the second ring was not demonstrated but was assumed also to occur by ring oxygen insertion, since the predicted oxygenation product was extracted from whole-cell incubation systems. Our investigation established that metabolism of the first ring cleavage intermediate, 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid, occurred through the sequential action of two inducible enzymes, a coenzyme A ester synthetase and an oxygenase. The oxygenase was purified to homogeneity and had a molecular weight of 106,000. This enzyme carried a single molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide and consisted of two identical subunits. Iron was not present at a significant level. The oxygenase was specific for NADPH as the electron donor and absolutely specific for the coenzyme A ester of 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid as the substrate. The reaction stoichiometry was compatible with this enzyme being a monooxygenase, and a mass spectral analysis of the methyl ester of the product confirmed the insertion of a single oxygen atom. The enzyme appeared to be analogous to, although distinct from. 2,5-diketocamphane 1,2-monooxygenase in catalyzing a ""biological Baeyer-Villiger"" reaction with the formation of a lactone. Structural analogy suggested that this lactone, like the first, was also unstable and susceptible to spontaneous ring opening, although this was not experimentally established.",10.1128/jb.153.1.140-152.1983,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6848481,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.153.1.140-152.1983,(+)-Camphor,

Laboratory experiments with DDE-containing marine sediments showed that DDE is dechlorinated to DDMU in both methanogenic and sulfidogenic microcosms and that DDD is dehydrochlorinated to DDMU three orders of magnitude more slowly. Thus, DDD does not appear to be an important precursor of the DDMU found in these sediments.

In this study, we investigated the ability of Pseudomonas acidovorans M3GY to transform DDE and its unchlorinated analog, 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE). While strain M3GY could grow on DPE, cells grown on DPE as a sole carbon source could not degrade DDE. Cells grown on biphenyl, however, did degrade DDE. Mass balance analysis of [14C]DDE showed transformation of more than 40% of the recoverable radioactivity. Nine chlorinated metabolites produced from DDE were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (GC-MS-FTIR) from cultures grown on biphenyl. Recovery of these metabolites demonstrates that biphenyl-grown cells degrade DDE through a meta-fission pathway.

This result suggested that the hydroxylations occurred at the ortho and meta positions on the aromatic ring. UV-visible spectrum spectrophotometric analysis of a yellow metabolite in the culture supernatant showed a maximum A402 with, under acidic and basic conditions, spectrophotometric characteristics similar to those of the aromatic ring meta-cleavage products. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid was detected by thin-layer chromatography radiochemical scanning in samples from mineralization experiments by comparison of Rf values of [14C]DDT intermediates with that of an authentic standard. These results were further confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.

TCE degradation was a strictly cometabolic process, requiring the presence of a cosubstrate, preferably formate, and oxygen. M. trichosporium OB3b cells degraded TCE only when grown under copper limitation and when the soluble methane monooxygenase was derepressed. During TCE degradation, nearly total dechlorination occurred, as indicated by the production of inorganic chloride, and only traces of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and trichloroacetaldehyde were produced. TCE degradation proceeded according to first-order kinetics from 0.1 to 0.0002 mM TCE with a rate constant of 2.14 ml min-1 mg of cells-1.

These chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) are often found together as cocontaminants in groundwater. The maximum degradation rates (k(max)) and half-saturation coefficients (K(s)) were determined in single compound kinetic tests. The highest k(max) was obtained for butane (2.6 micromol/mg TSS/h) followed by 1,1-DCE (1.3 micromol/mg TSS/h), 1,1-DCA (0.49 micromol/mg TSS/h), and 1,1,1-TCA (0.19 micromol/mg TSS/h), while the order of K(s) from the highest to lowest was 1,1-DCA (19 microM), butane (19 microM), 1,1,1-TCA (12 microM) and 1,1-DCE (1.5 microM). The inhibition types were determined using direct linear plots, while inhibition coefficients (K(ic) and K(iu)) were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression (NLSR) fits to the kinetic model of the identified inhibition type. Two different inhibition types were observed among the compounds. Competitive inhibition among CAHs was indicated from direct linear plots, and the CAHs also competitively inhibited butane utilization. 1,1-DCE was a stronger inhibitor than the other CAHs. Mixed inhibition of 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1-DCA, and 1,1-DCE transformations by butane was observed. Thus, both competitive and mixed inhibitions are important in cometabolism of CAHs by this butane culture. For competitive inhibition between CAHs, the ratio of the K(s) values was a reasonable indicator of competitive inhibition observed. Butane was a strong inhibitor of CAH transformation, having a much lower inhibition coefficient than the K(s) value of butane, while the CAHs were weak inhibitors of butane utilization.

The epoxide hydrolase gene coded for a protein of 294 amino acids with a molecular mass of 34 kDa. An identical epoxide hydrolase gene was cloned from chromosomal DNA of the closely related strain A. radiobacter CFZ11. The recombinant epoxide hydrolase was expressed up to 40% of the total cellular protein content in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and the purified enzyme had a kcat of 21 s-1 with epichlorohydrin. Amino acid sequence similarity of the epoxide hydrolase with eukaryotic epoxide hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, and bromoperoxidase A2 from Streptomyces aureofaciens indicated that it belonged to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family. This conclusion was supported by secondary structure predictions and analysis of the secondary structure with circular dichroism spectroscopy. The catalytic triad residues of epoxide hydrolase are proposed to be Asp107, His275, and Asp246. Replacement of these residues to Ala/Glu, Arg/Gln, and Ala, respectively, resulted in a dramatic loss of activity for epichlorohydrin.

The haloalkane dehalogenase and the trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase were expressed constitutively, whereas the cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase was inducible. The presence of these enzymes indicates that 1, 3-dichloropropene is hydrolyzed to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, which is oxidized in two steps to 3-chloroacrylic acid.

Monooxygenase-expressing bacteria have been shown to degrade dioxane via growth-supporting as well as cometabolic mechanisms. In this study, the intermediates of dioxane degradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria were determined by triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. The major intermediates were identified as 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), ethylene glycol, glycolate, and oxalate. Studies with uniformly labeled 14C dioxane showed that over 50% of the dioxane was mineralized to CO2 by CB1190, while 5% became biomass-associated after 48 h. Volatile organic acids and non-volatiles, respectively, accounted for 20 and 11% of the radiolabeled carbon. Although strains cometabolizing dioxane exhibited limited transformation capacities, nearly half of the initial dioxane was recovered as CO2. On the basis of these analytical results, we propose a pathway for dioxane oxidation by monooxygenase-expressing cells in which dioxane is first converted to 2-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane, which is spontaneously oxidized to HEAA. During a second monooxygenation step, HEAA is further hydroxylated, resulting in a mixture of dihydroxyethoxyacetic acids with a hydroxyl group at the ortho or para position. After cleavage of the second ether bond, small organic molecules such as ethylene glycol, glycolate, glyoxalate, and oxalate are progressively formed, which are then mineralized to CO2 via common cellular metabolic pathways.

In another pathway the methyl side chain is hydroxylated to -CH2-OH which is further converted to -CHO and -COOH resulting in the formation of naphthoic acid as the end product. In addition to this, 2-hydroxymethylnaphthalene formed by the hydroxylation of the methyl group of 2-methylnaphthalene undergoes aromatic ring hydroxylation. The resultant dihydrodiol is further oxidised by a series of enzyme catalysed reactions to form 4-hydroxymethyl catechol as the end product of the pathway.",10.1007/BF00288954,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8042906,https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/BF00288954,1-Naphthoic Acid,

The involvement of various metabolites as intermediates in the pathway was established by demonstrating relevant enzyme activities in cell-free extracts, oxygen uptake and transformation of metabolites by the whole cells. The results obtained from such studies suggest that the degradation of 1-naphthoic acid is initiated by double hydroxylation of the aromatic ring adjacent to the one bearing the carboxyl group, resulting in the formation of 1,2-dihydroxy-8-carboxynaphthalene.

Five polypeptides were produced when this DNA region was under control of the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli; however, no polypeptide was produced from the fourth open reading frame, ORF4. Homology searches of protein sequence databases were performed to determine if the proteins involved in 2,4,5-T metabolism were similar to other biodegradative enzymes. In addition, complementation studies were used to determine which genes were essential for the metabolism of 2,4,5-T. The first gene of the cluster, ORF1, encoded a 37-kDa polypeptide which was essential for complementation of PT88 and showed significant homology to putative trans-chlorodienelactone isomerases. The next gene, ORF2, was necessary for complementation and encoded a 47-kDa protein which showed homology to glutathione reductases. ORF3 was not essential for complementation; however, both the 23-kDa protein encoded by ORF3 and the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF4 showed homology to glutathione S-transferases.

BS- and TS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol BS or TS but failed to oxygenate the product of oxygenation of 2AS, 3-sulphocatechol (3SC). These observations were repeated with cell extracts and we concluded that there were two sets of desulphonative pathways in the organism, one for 2AS and one for BS and TS. We confirmed this hypothesis by separating the degradative enzymes from 2AS-, BS- or TS-grown cells. A 2AS dioxygenase system and a 3SC-2,3-dioxygenase (3SC23O) were detected in 2AS-grown cells only. In both BS- and TS-grown cells a dioxygenase system for BS and TS was observed as well as a principal catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O-III), neither of which was present in 2AS-grown cells. The 3SC23O was purified to near homogeneity, found to be monomeric (M(r) 42,000), and to catalyse 2,3-dioxygenation to a product that decayed spontaneously to sulphite and 2-hydroxymuconate. The 2AS dioxygenase system could cause not only deamination of 2AS but also desulphonation of BS and TS. The BS dioxygenase could desulphonate BS and apparently either desulphonate or deaminate 2AS. Strain O-1 thus seems to contain two putative, independently regulated operons involving oxygenation and spontaneous desulphonation(s). One operon encodes at least the 2AS dioxygenase system and 3SC23O whereas the other encodes at least the BS/TS dioxygenase system and C23O-III.",10.1099/13500872-140-7-1713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8075807,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/13500872-140-7-1713,2-Aminobenzenesulfonate,

A mutant of strain O-1 was found to excrete this intermediate, which was isolated and identified by m.s., 1H- and 13C-n.m.r. as 3-sulphocatechol (3SC). Proteins from cell extracts of strain O-1 were separated by anion-exchange chromatography. A multicomponent oxygenase was observed to convert 1 mol each of NADH, O2 and 2AS into 1 mol each of 3SC, NH3 and NAD+. The enzyme presumably catalysed formation of the ring of a 2-amino-2,3-diol moiety, and elimination in the amino group led to a rearomatization. 3SC was further degraded via meta ring cleavage, which could be prevented by inactivation of the 3-sulphocatechol-2,3-dioxygenase (3SC23O) with 3-chlorocatechol. In Tris buffer, the separated 3SC23O catalysed the reaction of 1 mol each of 3SC and O2 involving a transient yellow intermediate, and release of 1 mol of sulphite and two organic products. The major product was identified by n.m.r. and by g.c./m.s. as 5-carboxypenta-2,4-dien-5-olide (CPDO), an indicator of formation of 2-hydroxymuconic acid (2HM). The second product was identified as the Z,E isomer of 2HM by comparison with authentic material. When the CPDO in the product mixture was chemically hydrolysed to (Z,E)-2HM, 1 mol of (Z,E)-2HM/mol of 3SC was observed. If oxygenation of 3SC by 3SC23O was carried out in phosphate buffer, only a single product was detected, a keto form of 2HM. This dioate was also formed from authentic (Z,E)-2HM in phosphate buffer. Formation of the natural product (Z,E)-2HM from the xenobiotic, 3SC, seems to involve oxygenation to the unstable 2-hydroxy-6-sulphonomuconic acid semialdehyde, which hydrolyses spontaneously to 2HM. There would appear to be at least one spontaneous reaction per enzyme reaction in this pathway.",10.1042/bj3000429,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8002948,https://sci-hub.se/10.1042/bj3000429,2-Aminobenzenesulfonate,

Cells grown on 2-aminobenzoate are simultaneously adapted to growth with benzoate, whereas cells grown on benzoate degrade 2-aminobenzoate several times less efficiently than benzoate. Evidence for a new reductive pathway of aromatic metabolism and for four enzymes catalyzing the initial steps is presented. The organism contains 2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase), which forms 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA. 2-Aminobenzoyl-CoA is then reductively deaminated to benzoyl-CoA by an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reductase (deaminating), which requires a low potential reductant [Ti(III)]. The specific activity is 15 nmol of 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 mg-1 of protein at an optimal pH of 7. The two enzymes are induced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions only. Benzoyl-CoA is further converted in vitro by reduction with Ti(III) to six products; the same products are formed when benzoyl-CoA or 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA is incubated under reducing conditions. Two of them were identified preliminarily. One product is cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, the other is trans-2-hydroxycyclohexane-carboxyl-CoA. The complex transformation of benzoyl-CoA is ascribed to at least two enzymes, benzoyl-CoA reductase (aromatic ring reducing) and cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase. The reduction of benzoyl-CoA to alicyclic compounds is catalyzed by extracts from cells grown anaerobically on either 2-aminobenzoate or benzoate at almost the same rate (10 to 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein). In contrast, extracts from cells grown anaerobically on acetate or grown aerobically on benzoate or 2-aminobenzoate are inactive. This suggests a sequential induction of the enzymes.",10.1128/jb.174.11.3621-3628.1992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1592816,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.174.11.3621-3628.1992,2-Aminobenzoate (anaerobic),

TCMTB was the most toxic compound evaluated in both the acute and chronic tests with EC50s of 15.3 and 9.64 microg/L, respectively. 2-MBT, the first degradation product, was the second most toxic compound with acute and chronic EC50s of 4.19 and 1.25 mg/L, respectively. The toxicity of MTBT and HOBT were similar with acute EC50s of 12.7 and 15.1 mg/L and chronic EC50s of 6.36 and 8.31 mg/L, respectively. The least toxic compound was BT with acute and chronic EC50s of 24.6 and 54.9 mg/L, respectively. TCMTB was orders of magnitude more toxic than its degradation products. Toxicity data on these benzothiazole degradation products is important because of concerns regarding their release, degradation, persistence, and non-target organism effects in aquatic ecosystems.",10.1007/s00244-004-0105-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15750776,https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s00244-004-0105-1,2-Mercaptobenzothiazole,
15941012,Human health risk assessment of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole in drinking water.,Toxicology and industrial health,"Whittaker MH, Gebhart AM, Miller TC, Hammer F","2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is used as a vulcanization accelerator in rubber products that come into contact with potable drinking water. When such products are evaluated for contact with potable water and submitted for ANSI/NSF Standard 61 certification, any chemical extracting from these products must be below an appropriate action level of exposure. As defined by Standard 61, a total allowable concentration (TAC) is the maximum concentration of a nonregulated contaminant allowed in a public drinking water supply, and the single product allowable concentration (SPAC) is 10% of the TAC. Currently, MBT has a TAC of 40 microg/L and a SPAC of 4 microg/L. A comprehensive health effects evaluation of MBT was performed to determine whether these action levels should be revised. Epidemiological investigations indicate that workers occupationally exposed to MBT have an increased risk of death from bladder cancer. Genotoxicity investigations in bacterial and mammalian test systems provide some evidence indicating that MBT has the potential to induce mutations and chromosomal aberrations. Toxicity studies in rats and mice chronically exposed to MBT identified increases in various tumours, such as adrenal gland tumours, pituitary gland tumours, liver tumours and renal pelvis tumours. The biological significance of most of these tumours is questionable due to a variety of factors, such as a lack of dose-response between tumour incidence and dose, and the effect of test article vehicle (corn oil) upon tumour rates. Potential human health effects of exposure to MBT can be predicted from an NTP 2-year cancer study in rats, as well as epidemiological investigations in occupationally exposed workers. A comprehensive review of the epidemiological and toxicological dataset for MBT indicates that the induction of renal pelvis transitional cell tumours is the most sensitive and relevant health effects endpoint upon which to base a revised TAC and SPAC. A multistage model was used to extrapolate to low-dose MBT exposures due to the genotoxicity and clastogenicity of MBT. A TAC of 600 microg/L was derived for MBT, and was based upon an LED10 of 157.681 mg/kg per day. A SPAC of 60 microg/L was derived by multiplying the revised TAC by 0.10, and rounding to one significant figure. These revised action levels are based upon the most sensitive health effects endpoint, as well as current cancer risk assessment methodology.",10.1191/0748233704th199oa,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15941012,https://sci-hub.se/10.1191/0748233704th199oa,2-Mercaptobenzothiazole,

This toxicity towards several bacteria is now confirmed and is situated at around 100 mg MBT l-1. Octanol-water partition coefficients indicated that MBT might interact with membrane-bound systems. This was confirmed through experiments showing that bacterial cell respiration was inhibited using lactate or succinate as substrates. Using these substrates and also NADH, it was found that their oxidation was also inhibited using isolated membrane fragments of Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans. Methylene blue reduction was also found to be inhibited. The oxidation of ascorbate was not inhibited in P. denitrificans. From these results it is suggested that MBT might interact with the respiratory chain at the level of flavoproteins or quinones and Fe-S clusters.",10.1007/BF00173931,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7765737,https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/BF00173931,2-Mercaptobenzothiazole,

15372028,Anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation in deep subsurface oil reservoirs.,Nature,"Aitken CM, Jones DM, Larter SR","Biodegradation of crude oil in subsurface petroleum reservoirs is an important alteration process with major economic consequences. Aerobic degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at the surface is well documented and it has long been thought that the flow of oxygen- and nutrient-bearing meteoric waters into reservoirs was necessary for in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation. The occurrence of biodegraded oils in reservoirs where aerobic conditions are unlikely, together with the identification of several anaerobic microorganisms in oil fields and the discovery of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation mechanisms, suggests that anaerobic degradation processes could also be responsible. The extent of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation processes in the world's deep petroleum reservoirs, however, remains strongly contested. Moreover, no organism has yet been isolated that has been shown to degrade hydrocarbons under the conditions found in deep petroleum reservoirs. Here we report the isolation of metabolites indicative of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation from a large fraction of 77 degraded oil samples from both marine and lacustrine sources from around the world, including the volumetrically important Canadian tar sands. Our results therefore suggest that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation is a common process in biodegraded subsurface oil reservoirs.",10.1038/nature02922,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15372028,https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/nature02922,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic),
11097910,Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene by a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture.,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Annweiler E, Materna A, Safinowski M, Kappler A, Richnow HH, Michaelis W, Meckenstock RU","Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture. Metabolite analyses revealed two groups of degradation products. The first group comprised two succinic acid adducts which were identified as naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid and naphthyl-2-methylene-succinic acid by comparison with chemically synthesized reference compounds. Naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid accumulated to 0.5 microM in culture supernatants. Production of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was analyzed in enzyme assays with dense cell suspensions. The conversion of 2-methylnaphthalene to naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was detected at a specific activity of 0.020 +/- 0.003 nmol min(-1) mg of protein(-1) only in the presence of cells and fumarate. We conclude that under anaerobic conditions 2-methylnaphthalene is activated by fumarate addition to the methyl group, as is the case in anaerobic toluene degradation. The second group of metabolites comprised 2-naphthoic acid and reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives, including 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, octahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid. These compounds were also identified in an earlier study as products of anaerobic naphthalene degradation with the same enrichment culture. A pathway for anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene analogous to that for anaerobic toluene degradation is proposed.",10.1128/AEM.66.12.5329-5333.2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11097910,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.66.12.5329-5333.2000,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic),
11440239,Evidence for aromatic ring reduction in the biodegradation pathway of carboxylated naphthalene by a sulfate reducing consortium.,Biodegradation,"Zhang X, Sullivan ER, Young LY","Naphthalene was used as a model compound in order to study the anaerobic pathway of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation. Previously we had determined that carboxylation is an initial step for anaerobic metabolism of naphthalene, but no other intermediate metabolites were identified (Zhang & Young 1997). In the present study we further elucidate the pathway with the identification of six novel naphthalene metabolites detected when cultures were fed naphthalene in the presence of its analog 1 -fluoronaphthalene. Results from cultures supplemented with either deuterated naphthalene or non-deuterated naphthalene plus [13C]bicarbonate confirm that the metabolites originated from naphthalene. Three of these metabolites were identified by comparison with the following standards: 2-naphthoic acid (2-NA), 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid. The presence of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-NA as a metabolite of naphthalene degradation indicates that the first reduction reaction occurs at the unsubstituted ring, rather than the carboxylated ring. The overall results suggest that after the initial carboxylation of naphthalene, 2-NA is sequentially reduced to decahydro-2-naphthoic acid through 5 hydrogenation reactions, each of which eliminated one double bond. Incorporation of deuterium atoms from D2O into 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid suggests that water is the proton source for hydrogenation.",10.1023/a:1011128109670,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11440239,https://sci-hub.se/10.1023/a:1011128109670,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic),
15500985,Enzymatic reactions in anaerobic 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by the sulphate-reducing enrichment culture N 47.,FEMS microbiology letters,"Safinowski M, Meckenstock RU","The upper pathway of anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was studied with a sulphate-reducing enrichment culture, which is able to grow with naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene as sole carbon source and electron donor. Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene is initiated by an addition of fumarate to the methyl-group producing the first intermediate, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate. In a subsequent beta-oxidation of the original methyl atom, the central metabolite 2-naphthoic acid is generated. In the following pathway, the aromatic ring system is reduced, cleaved, and finally oxidised to CO(2). Here, we present two new enzymatic reactions of the 2-methylnaphthalene degradation pathway that were measured in crude cell extracts. All metabolites were identified with HPLC by co-elution with synthesised reference substances. The first enzyme, succinyl-CoA:naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate CoA-transferase, catalyses the activation of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid to the corresponding CoA ester. The average specific activity of this enzyme was 19.6 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1). The CoA-transfer was not inhibited by sodium borohydride and only partially by hydroxylamine, indicating that this enzyme belongs to the family III of CoA-transferases like the corresponding enzyme in the anaerobic toluene degradation pathway. The product of this CoA-transfer reaction, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA is then oxidised in a reaction to naphthyl-2-methylene-succinyl-CoA by the enzyme naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The specific activity of this enzyme was 0.115 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1). The enzymatic activity could only be detected using phenazine methosulphate as electron acceptor. No activity was observed with natural electron acceptors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or flavin adenine dinucleotide. The two novel reactions presented here demonstrate that the original methyl-group of 2-methylnaphthalene is oxidised to the carboxyl group of 2-naphthoic acid in the upper part of the anaerobic degradation pathway.",10.1016/j.femsle.2004.09.014,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15500985,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.femsle.2004.09.014,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic),
11823228,"Identical ring cleavage products during anaerobic degradation of naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and tetralin indicate a new metabolic pathway.",Applied and environmental microbiology,"Annweiler E, Michaelis W, Meckenstock RU","Anaerobic degradation of naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture obtained from a contaminated aquifer. Degradation studies with tetralin revealed 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid as a major metabolite indicating activation by addition of a C(1) unit to tetralin, comparable to the formation of 2-naphthoic acid in anaerobic naphthalene degradation. The activation reaction was specific for the aromatic ring of tetralin; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid was not detected. The reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives tetrahydro-, octahydro-, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid were identified consistently in supernatants of cultures grown with either naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, or tetralin. In addition, two common ring cleavage products were identified. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-resolution GC-MS analyses revealed a compound with a cyclohexane ring and two carboxylic acid side chains as one of the first ring cleavage products. The elemental composition was C(11)H(16)O(4) (C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid), indicating that all carbon atoms of the precursor 2-naphthoic acid structure were preserved in this ring cleavage product. According to the mass spectrum, the side chains could be either an acetic acid and a propenic acid, or a carboxy group and a butenic acid side chain. A further ring cleavage product was identified as 2-carboxycyclohexylacetic acid and was assumed to be formed by beta-oxidation of one of the side chains of the C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid. Stable isotope-labeling growth experiments with either (13)C-labeled naphthalene, per-deuterated naphthalene-d(8), or a (13)C-bicarbonate-buffered medium showed that the ring cleavage products derived from the introduced carbon source naphthalene. The series of identified metabolites suggests that anaerobic degradation of naphthalenes proceeds via reduction of the aromatic ring system of 2-naphthoic acid to initiate ring cleavage in analogy to the benzoyl-coenzyme A pathway for monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Our findings provide strong indications that further degradation goes through saturated compounds with a cyclohexane ring structure and not through monoaromatic compounds. A metabolic pathway for anaerobic degradation of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 2-naphthoic acid as the central intermediate is proposed.",10.1128/AEM.68.2.852-858.2002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11823228,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.68.2.852-858.2002,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic),

Rats were pre-treated with a single dose of 2-NP (100 mg/kg body weight dissolved in canola oil). Afterward, the animals were post-treated with a dose of diphenyl diselenide (10, 50 or 100 micromol/kg). The parameters that indicate tissue damage such as liver histopathology, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), urea and creatinine were determined. Since the liver damage induced by 2-NP is related to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbic acid level were also evaluated. Diphenyl diselenide (50 and 100 micromol/kg) effectively restored the increase of ALT and AST activities and urea level when compared to the 2-NP group. At the higher dose, diphenyl diselenide decreased GGT activity. Treatment with diphenyl diselenide, at all doses, effectively ameliorated the increase of hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation when compared to 2-NP group. 2-NP reduced CAT activity and neither alter SOD activity nor ascorbic acid level. This study points out the involvement of CAT activity in 2-NP-induced acute liver damage and suggests that the post-treatment with diphenyl diselenide was effective in restoring the hepatic damage induced by 2-NP.",10.1016/j.cbi.2005.12.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16445897,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.cbi.2005.12.010,2-Nitropropane,

The enzyme is composed of two subunits; the molecular weight of each subunit is approximately 40,000. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of nitroalkanes to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds. It acts on 2-nitropropane better than on nitroethane and 1-nitropropane, and anionic forms of nitroalkanes are much better substrates than are neutral forms. The enzyme does not act on aromatic compounds. When the enzyme reaction was conducted in an 18O2 atmosphere with the anionic form of 2-nitropropane as the substrate, acetone (with a molecular mass of 60 Da) was produced. This indicates that the oxygen atom of acetone was derived from molecular oxygen, not from water; hence, the enzyme is an oxygenase. The reaction stoichiometry was 2CH3CH(NO2)CH3 + O2-->2CH3COCH3 + 2HNO2, which is identical to that of the reaction of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Hansenula mrakii. The reaction of the Neurospora enzyme was inhibited by superoxide anion scavengers in the same manner as that of the Hansenula enzyme. Both of these enzymes are flavoenzymes; however, the Neurospora enzyme contains flavin mononucleotide as a prosthetic group, whereas the Hansenula enzyme contains flavin adenine dinucleotide.",10.1128/AEM.64.3.1029-1033.1998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9501443,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.64.3.1029-1033.1998,2-Nitropropane,

To identify genes coding for enzymes of DTDP catabolism, Tn5::mob-induced mutants of T. mimigardefordensis were generated. Screening of transposon mutant libraries yielded many mutants fully or partially impaired in utilizing DTDP as a carbon source. Mapping of the insertion loci in some mutants identified four disrupted open reading frames (ORFs) with putative metabolic functions. The ORFs were assigned function on the basis of homologies with lpdA (EC 1.8.1.4), cdo (EC 1.13.11.20), sucCD (EC 6.2.1.5), and acnB (EC 4.2.1.3). Tn5::mob insertions occurred additionally in the vicinity of heat shock protein-encoding genes. The predicted function of the LpdA homologue in T. mimigardefordensis is cleavage of the disulfide bond of DTDP to form two molecules of 3MP. Cdo catalyzes the conversion of the sulfhydryl group of 3MP, yielding the corresponding sulfinic acid, 3SP. SucCD exhibits thiokinase activity, ligating coenzyme A (CoA) with 3SP to form 3SP-CoA. Afterwards, an elimination of sulfite via a putative desulfinase is expected. acnB encodes a putative 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase. Therefore, a new pathway is proposed for the catabolism of DTDP via 3MP, 3SP, and 3SP-CoA toward propionyl-CoA, which is then further catabolized via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle in T. mimigardefordensis.",10.1128/AEM.00422-08,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18456849,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.00422-08,"3,3`-Dithiodipropionate",

MSAD has no sequence homology to previously characterized decarboxylases, but the presence of a conserved motif (Pro1-(X)8 -Gly-Arg11-X-Asp-X-Gln) in its N-terminal region suggested a relationship to the tautomerase superfamily. Sequence analysis identified Pro1 and Arg75 as potential active site residues that might be involved in the MSAD activity. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the importance of these residues to activity and provided further evidence to implicate MSAD as a new member of the tautomerase superfamily. MSAD is the first identified decarboxylase in the superfamily and is possibly the first characterized member of a new and distinct family within this superfamily. Malonate semialdehyde is analogous to a beta-keto acid, and enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of these acids generally utilize metal ion catalysis, a Schiff base intermediate, or polarization of the carbonyl group by hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions. A mechanistic analysis shows that the rate of the reaction is not affected by the presence of a metal ion or EDTA while the incubation of MSAD with the substrate in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride results in the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The site of modification is Pro1. These observations are consistent with the latter two mechanisms, but do not exclude the first mechanism. Based on the sequence analysis, the outcome of the mutagenesis and mechanistic experiments, and the roles determined for Pro1 and the conserved arginine in all tautomerase superfamily members characterized thus far, two mechanistic scenarios are proposed for the MSAD-catalyzed reaction in which Pro1 and Arg75 play prominent roles.",10.1074/jbc.M306706200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14506256,https://sci-hub.se/10.1074/jbc.M306706200,3-Chloroacrylic Acid,

The strains were isolated after initial enrichment on one of the monofluoro-, monochloro-, or monobromo-benzoate isomers with nitrate as an electron acceptor, yielding a total of 33 strains isolated from the different halobenzoate-utilizing enrichment cultures. Each isolate could grow on the selected halobenzoate with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. The isolates obtained on 2-fluorobenzoate could use 2-fluorobenzoate under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions, but did not degrade other halobenzoates. In contrast, the 4-fluorobenzoate isolates degraded 4-fluorobenzoate under denitrifying conditions only, but utilized 2-fluorobenzoate under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions. The strains isolated on either 3-chlorobenzoate or 3-bromobenzoate could use 3-chlorobenzoate, 3-bromobenzoate, and 2- and 4-fluorobenzoates under denitrifying conditions. The isolates were identified and classified on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and their cellular fatty acid profiles. They were placed in nine genera belonging to either the alpha-, beta-, or gamma-branch of the Proteobacteria, namely, Acidovorax, Azoarcus, Bradyrhizobium, Ochrobactrum, Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium, Ensifer, and Thauera.

Nitration was not mediated by a free radical mechanism because hydroxyl radical scavengers did not reduce either superoxide dismutase or Fe3+EDTA-catalyzed nitration and nitrogen dioxide was not a significant product from either catalyst. Rather, metal ions appear to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite to form a nitronium-like species (NO2+). The calculated energy for separating peroxynitrous acid into hydroxide ion and nitronium ion is 13 kcal.mol-1 at pH 7.0. Fe3+EDTA catalyzed nitration with an activation energy of 12 kcal.mol-1 at a rate of 5700 M-1.s-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5. The reaction rate of peroxynitrite with bovine Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase was 10(5) M-1.s-1 at low superoxide dismutase concentrations, but the rate of nitration became independent of superoxide dismutase concentration above 10 microM with only 9% of added peroxynitrite yielding nitrophenol. We propose that peroxynitrite anion is more stable in the cis conformation, whereas only a higher energy species in the trans conformation can fit in the active site of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. At high superoxide dismutase concentrations, phenolic nitration may be limited by the rate of isomerization from the cis to trans conformations of peroxynitrite as well as by competing pathways for peroxynitrite decomposition. In contrast, Fe3+EDTA appears to react directly with the cis anion, resulting in greater nitration yields.",10.1016/0003-9861(92)90432-v,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1416975,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/0003-9861(92)90432-v,3-Nitrotyrosine Family,

Herein, we show that extracellular 3-nitrotyrosine is transported via the l-aromatic amino acid transporter in nondopaminergic NT2 cells, whereas in dopaminergic PC12 cells, it is transported by both the l-aromatic amino acid and the dopamine transporters. In both cell lines, 3-nitrotyrosine is a substrate for tyrosine tubulin ligase, resulting in its incorporation into the C terminus of alpha-tubulin. In NT2 cells, incorporation of 3-nitrotyrosine into alpha-tubulin induces a progressive, reversible reorganization of the microtubule architecture. In PC12 cells, 3-nitrotyrosine decreases intracellular dopamine levels and is metabolized by the concerted action of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase. Intracellular levels of 133 micromol of 3-nitrotyrosine per mole of tyrosine did not alter NT2 viability but induced PC12 apoptosis. The cell death was reversed by caspases and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 3-Nitrotyrosine induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive primary rat neurons, which was also prevented by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor.

This cluster maps at min 57.5 of the chromosome and is composed of five catabolic genes arranged as a putative operon (hcaA1A2CBD) and two additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction that encode a potential permease (hcaT) and a regulator (hcaR). Sequence comparisons revealed that while hcaA1A2CD genes encode the four subunits of the 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase, the hcaB gene codes for the corresponding cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. This type of catabolic module is homologous to those encoding class IIB dioxygenases and becomes the first example of such a catabolic cluster in E. coli. The inducible expression of the hca genes requires the presence of the hcaR gene product, which acts as a transcriptional activator and shows significant sequence similarity to members of the LysR family of regulators. Interestingly, the HcaA1A2CD and HcaB enzymes are able to oxidize not only PP to 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) but also cinnamic acid (CI) to its corresponding 2, 3-dihydroxy derivative. Further catabolism of DHPP requires the mhp-encoded meta fission pathway for the mineralization of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP) (A. Ferrández, J. L. García, and E. Díaz, J. Bacteriol. 179:2573-2581, 1997). Expression in Salmonella typhimurium of the mhp genes alone or in combination with the hca cluster allowed the growth of the recombinant bacteria in 3-hydroxycinnamic acid (3HCI) and CI, respectively.

9699867,An updated review of environmental estrogen and androgen mimics and antagonists.,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,"Sonnenschein C, Soto AM","For the last 40 y, substantial evidence has surfaced on the hormone-like effects of environmental chemicals such as pesticides and industrial chemicals in wildlife and humans. The endocrine and reproductive effects of these chemicals are believed to be due to their ability to: (1) mimic the effect of endogenous hormones, (2) antagonize the effect of endogenous hormones, (3) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of endogenous hormones, and (4) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of hormone receptors. The discovery of hormone-like activity of these chemicals occurred long after they were released into the environment. Aviation crop dusters handling DDT were found to have reduced sperm counts, and workers at a plant producing the insecticide kepone were reported to have lost their libido, became impotent and had low sperm counts. Subsequently, experiments conducted in lab animals demonstrated unambiguously the estrogenic activity of these pesticides. Man-made compounds used in the manufacture of plastics were accidentally found to be estrogenic because they fouled experiments conducted in laboratories studying natural estrogens. For example, polystyrene tubes released nonylphenol, and polycarbonate flasks released bisphenol-A. Alkylphenols are used in the synthesis of detergents (alkylphenol polyethoxylates) and as antioxidants. These detergents are not estrogenic; however, upon degradation during sewage treatment they may release estrogenic alkylphenols. The surfactant nonoxynol is used as intravaginal spermicide and condom lubricant. When administered to lab animals it is metabolized to free nonylphenol. Bisphenol-A was found to contaminate the contents of canned foods; these tin cans are lined with lacquers such as polycarbonate. Bisphenol-A is also used in dental sealants and composites. We found that this estrogen leaches from the treated teeth into saliva; up to 950 microg of bisphenol-A were retrieved from saliva collected during the first hour after polymerization. Other xenoestrogens recently identified among chemicals used in large volumes are the plastizicers benzylbutylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, the antioxidant butylhydroxyanisole, the rubber additive p-phenylphenol and the disinfectant o-phenylphenol. These compounds act cumulatively. In fact, feminized male fish were found near sewage outlets in several rivers in the U.K.; a mixture of chemicals including alkyl phenols resulting from degradation of detergents during sewage treatment seemed to be the causal agent. Estrogen mimics are just a class of endocrine disruptors. Recent studies identified antiandrogenic activity in environmental chemicals such as vinclozolin, a fungicide, and DDE, and insecticide. Moreover, a single chemical may produce neurotoxic, estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects. It has been hypothesized that endocrine disruptors may play a role in the decrease in the quantity and quality of human semen during the last 50 y, as well as in the increased incidence of testicular cancer and cryptorchidism in males and breast cancer incidence in both females and males in the industrialized word. To explore this hypothesis it is necessary to identify putative causal agents by the systematic screening of environmental chemicals and chemicals present in human foods to assess their ability to disrupt the endocrine system. In addition, it will be necessary to develop methods to measure cumulative exposure to (a) estrogen mimics, (b) antiandrogens, and (c) other disruptors.",10.1016/s0960-0760(98)00027-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9699867,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/s0960-0760(98)00027-2,"4-(1-Ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)phenol",

Here, we demonstrate with 18O-labeling experiments that the ipso-hydroxy group was derived from molecular oxygen and that, in the major pathway for cleavage of the alkyl moiety, the resulting nonanol metabolite contained an oxygen atom originating from water and not from the ipso-hydroxy group, as was previously assumed. Our results clearly show that the alkyl cation derived from the alpha-quaternary nonylphenol 4-(1-ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-phenol through ipso-hydroxylation and subsequent dissociation of the 4-alkyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexadienone intermediate preferentially combines with a molecule of water to yield the corresponding alcohol and hydroquinone. However, the metabolism of certain alpha,alpha-dimethyl-substituted nonylphenols appears to also involve a reaction of the cation with the ipso-hydroxy group to form the corresponding 4-alkoxyphenols. Growth, oxygen uptake, and 18O-labeling experiments clearly indicate that strain Bayram metabolized 4-t-butoxyphenol by ipso-hydroxylation to a hemiketal followed by spontaneous dissociation to the corresponding alcohol and p-quinone. Hydroquinone effected high oxygen uptake in assays with induced resting cells as well as in assays with cell extracts. This further corroborates the role of hydroquinone as the ring cleavage intermediate during degradation of 4-nonylphenols and 4-alkoxyphenols.",10.1128/AEM.02994-06,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17369338,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.02994-06,"4-(1-Ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)phenol",

Formate, but not the alternative likely product formamide, was further oxidized fivefold faster by 4-hydroxypyridine-grown washed cells than by similar organisms grown on succinate. 3. The oxidation of pyridine-3,4-diol by crude extracts at pH8.5 required 1mol of O(2)/mol of substrate, produced 1mol of acid and led to the formation of formate and a new compound with an extinction maximum of 285nm (Compound I). This step was believed to be mediated by a new labile dioxygenase (t((1/2))=4h at pH7.0, 4 degrees C) cleaving the pyridine ring between C-2 and C-3. 4. Many of the properties of this pyridine-3,4-diol dioxygenase paralleled those of the extradiol (;meta') oxygenases of aromatic-ring cleavage.

The action of naphthalene dioxygenase on a variety of methyl-substituted aromatic compounds, including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and isomers of dimethylnaphthalene, resulted in the formation of benzylic alcohols, i.e., methyl group monooxygenation products, which were subsequently converted to the corresponding carboxylic acids by dehydrogenase(s) in the host strain. Benzylic monooxygenation of methyl groups was strongly predominant over aromatic ring dioxygenation and essentially nonspecific with respect to the substitution pattern of the aromatic substrates. In addition to monooxygenating benzylic methyl and methylene groups, naphthalene dioxygenase behaved as a sulfoxygenase, catalyzing monooxygenation of the sulfur heteroatom of 3-methylbenzothiophene.",10.1128/aem.62.2.507-514.1996,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16535238,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.62.2.507-514.1996,Acenaphthylene,

Metabolites produced from Tn5-induced mutant strains B1, B5, and A53 were purified by thin-layer chromatography and silica gel column chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry.

Site-specific labeling at the benzylic position of acenaphthene allows 13C-NMR detection of chemical changes due to initial oxidations catalyzed by bacterial enzymes of aromatic hydrocarbon catabolism. Biodegradation of [1-13C]acenaphthene in the presence of naphthalene or creosote polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) was examined with an undefined mixed bacterial culture (established by enrichment on creosote PACs) and with isolates of individual naphthalene- and phenanthrene-degrading strains from this culture. From 13C-NMR spectra of extractable materials obtained in time course biodegradation experiments under optimized conditions, a number of signals were assigned to accumulated products such as 1-acenaphthenol, 1-acenaphthenone, acenaphthene-1,2-diol and naphthalene 1,8-dicarboxylic acid, formed by benzylic oxidation of acenaphthene and subsequent reactions. Limited degradation of acenaphthene could be attributed to its oxidation by naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase or related dioxygenases, indicative of certain limitations of the undefined mixed culture with respect to acenaphthene catabolism. Coinoculation of the mixed culture with cells of acenaphthene-grown strain Pseudomonas sp. strain A2279 mitigated the accumulation of partial transformation products and resulted in more complete degradation of acenaphthene.

To isolate the genes responsible for acenaphthene degradation, transposon mutagenesis was performed on strain A4 and four mini-Tn5-inserted mutants lacking the ability to utilize acenaphthene were isolated. In three of the four mini-Tn5 inserted mutants, the mini-Tn5s were inserted into the same locus (within about 16 kb) as the arhA1A2 genes, which had previously been identified as the genes encoding the terminal oxygenase components for the initial oxygenation of acenaphthene. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the corresponding 16.4 kb DNA fragment revealed the existence of 16 ORFs and a partial ORF. From these ORFs, the genes encoding the ferredoxin (ArhA3) and ferredoxin reductase (ArhA4) complementary to ArhA1A2 were identified. RT-PCR analysis suggested that a 13.5 kb gene cluster, consisting of 13 ORFs and including all the arhA genes, forms an operon, although it includes several ORFs that are apparently unnecessary for acenaphthene degradation. Furthermore, using gene disruption and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, the LysR-type activator, ArhR, required for expression of the 13.5 kb gene cluster was also identified.

Mechanism of acetylene reduction and its inhibition by carbon monoxide.,The Biochemical journal,"Lowe DJ, Fisher K, Thorneley RN","The electron flux through the MoFe-protein of nitrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae determines the absolute and relative rates of 2H+ reduction to H2 and acetylene (C2H2) reduction to ethylene (C2H4) at saturating levels of reductant (Na2S2O4) and MgATP. High electron flux, induced by a high Fe-protein (Kp2)/MoFe protein (Kp1) ratio, favours C2H2 reduction. These data can be explained if ethylene, the two-electron reduction product of C2H2, is not released until three electrons have been transferred from Kp2 to Kp1. This explanation is also consistent with a pre-steady-state lag phase for C2H4 formation of 250 ms observed when functioning enzyme is quenched with acid. Electron flux through nitrogenase is inhibited by C2H2 at high protein concentrations. This is because the association rate between Kp1 and oxidized Kp2 is enhanced by C2H2, leading to an increased steady-state concentration of the inhibitory complex Kp2oxKp1C2H2. This effect is not relieved by CO. Thus CO and C2H2 (or C2H4) must be bound at the same time to distinct sites, presumably at Mo or Fe centres, on the enzyme.",10.1042/bj2720621,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2268290,https://sci-hub.se/10.1042/bj2720621,Acetylene,

Three Pseudomonas strains, designated 5R, DFC49, and DFC50, were recovered from a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading inoculum developed from a manufactured gas plant soil slurry reactor. Plasmids pKA1, pKA2, and pKA3, approximately 100 kb in size, were isolated from these strains and characterized. These plasmids have homologous regions of upper and lower NAH7 plasmid catabolic genes. By conjugation experiments, these plasmids, including NAH7, have been shown to encode the genotype for mineralization of [9-14C]phenanthrene and [U-14C]anthracene, as well as [1-14C]naphthalene. One strain, Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL, which has the complete lower pathway inactivated by transposon insertion in nahG, accumulated a metabolite from phenanthrene and anthracene degradation.

In batch cultures, an effective substrate degradation was observed. The carbon balance, including naphthalene, metabolites, biomass, and CO(2), was determined by the application of [1-(13)C]naphthalene. The incorporation of naphthalene-derived carbon into the bulk biomass as well as into specified biomass fractions such as fatty acids and amino acids was confirmed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and isotope analyses. Metabolites were characterized by GC-MS; the established structures allow tracing the degradation pathway under thermophilic conditions.

The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan.

A gene conferring the atrazine-clearing phenotype was subsequently subcloned as a 1.9-kb AvaI fragment in pACYC184, designated pMD4, and was expressed in E. coli. This result and random Tn5 mutagenesis established that the 1.9-kb AvaI fragment was essential for atrazine dechlorination. High-pressure liquid and thin-layer chromatographic analyses were used to rigorously establish that E. coli containing pMD4 degraded atrazine and accumulated hydroxyatrazine. Hydroxyatrazine was detected only transiently in E. coli containing pMD1. This is consistent with the idea that hydroxyatrazine is the first metabolite in atrazine degradation by Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP.

P. Wackett, K. L. Boundy-Mills, R. T. Mandelbaum, and M. J. Sadowsky, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:3373-3378, 1995). In this study, we show that this fragment also contained the second gene of the atrazine metabolic pathway, atzB. AtzB catalyzed the transformation of hydroxyatrazine to N-isopropylammelide. The product was identified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometery, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tn5 mutagenesis of pMD1 was used to determine that atzB was located 8 kb downstream of atzA. Hydroxyatrazine degradation activity was localized to a 4.0-kb ClaI fragment, which was subcloned into the vector pACYC184 to produce plasmid pATZB-2. The DNA sequence of this region was determined and found to contain two large overlapping divergent open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 was identified as the coding region of atzB by demonstrating that (i) only ORF1 was transcribed in Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, (ii) a Tn5 insertion in ORF2 did not disrupt function, and (iii) codon usage was consistent with ORF1 being translated. AtzB had 25% amino acid identity with TrzA, a protein that catalyzes a hydrolytic deamination of the s-triazine substrate melamine. The atzA and atzB genes catalyze the first two steps of the metabolic pathway in a bacterium that rapidly metabolizes atrazine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and chloride.",10.1128/aem.63.3.916-923.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9055410,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.63.3.916-923.1997,Atrazine,

The first enzyme, AtzA, catalyzes the hydrolytic dechlorination of atrazine, yielding hydroxyatrazine. The second enzyme, AtzB, catalyzes hydroxyatrazine deamidation, yielding N-isopropylammelide. In this study, the third gene in the atrazine catabolic pathway, atzC, was cloned from a Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP cosmid library as a 25-kb EcoRI DNA fragment in Escherichia coli. The atzC gene was further delimited by functional analysis following transposon Tn5 mutagenesis and subcloned as a 2.0-kb EcoRI-AvaI fragment. An E. coli strain containing this DNA fragment expressed N-isopropylammelide isopropylamino hydrolase activity, metabolizing N-isopropylammelide stoichiometrically to cyanuric acid and N-isopropylamine. The 2.0-kb DNA fragment was sequenced and found to contain a single open reading frame of 1,209 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 403 amino acids. AtzC showed modest sequence identity of 29 and 25%, respectively, to cytosine deaminase and dihydroorotase, both members of an amidohydrolase protein superfamily. The sequence of AtzC was compared to that of E. coli cytosine deaminase in the regions containing the five ligands to the catalytically important metal for the protein. Pairwise comparison of the 35 amino acids showed 61% sequence identity and 85% sequence similarity. AtzC is thus assigned to the amidohydrolase protein family that includes cytosine deaminase, urease, adenine deaminase, and phosphotriester hydrolase. Similar sequence comparisons of the most highly conserved regions indicated that the AtzA and AtzB proteins also belong to the same amidohydrolase family. Overall, the data suggest that AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC diverged from a common ancestor and, by random events, have been reconstituted onto an atrazine catabolic plasmid.",10.1128/JB.180.1.152-158.1998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9422605,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.180.1.152-158.1998,Atrazine,

Tropine was also used as a sole carbon and energy source. The methyl group of tropine was eliminated as formaldehyde, and the nortropine thus formed was a precursor of 6-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione. Ammonia was detected as a product of nitrogen elimination. 6-Hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione was oxidized to cyclohepta-1,3,5-trione by an induced NAD(sup+)-specific dehydrogenase. Although cyclohepta-1,3,5-trione is a (beta)-diketone with two potential hydrolytic cleavage sites, an induced hydrolase was specific for one of these sites, with 4,6-dioxoheptanoate as the only hydrolysis product. Unlike the alternative cleavage product (3,6-dioxoheptanoate), this compound is also a (beta)-diketone, and a second hydrolytic cleavage formed succinate and acetone. Although Pseudomonas strain AT3 was not capable of growth with acetone, the compound was not detected in the culture medium and may have been lost to the atmosphere.

In the case of the common intermediate benzoate, the ring cleavage substrates are either catechol (in bacteria) or 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate, mainly in fungi). We have shown before that many bacteria, e.g. Azoarcus evansii, the organism studied here, use a completely different mechanism. This elaborate pathway requires formation of benzoyl-CoA, followed by an oxygenase reaction and a nonoxygenolytic ring cleavage. Benzoyl-CoA transformation is catalyzed by the iron-containing benzoyl-CoA oxygenase (BoxB) in conjunction with an FAD and iron-sulfur centers containing reductase (BoxA), which donates electrons from NADPH. Here we show that benzoyl-CoA oxygenase actually does not form the 2,3-dihydrodiol of benzoyl-CoA, as formerly postulated, but the 2,3-epoxide. An enoyl-CoA hydratase (BoxC) uses two molecules of water to first hydrolytically open the ring of 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA, which may proceed via its tautomeric seven-membered oxepin ring form. Then ring C2 is hydrolyzed off as formic acid, yielding 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde. The semialdehyde is oxidized by a NADP(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (BoxD) to 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA. Final products of the pathway are formic acid, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA. This overlooked pathway occurs in 4-5% of all bacteria whose genomes have been sequenced and represents an elegant strategy to cope with the high resonance energy of aromatic substrates by forming a nonaromatic epoxide.",10.1074/jbc.M110.124156,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20452977,https://sci-hub.se/10.1074/jbc.M110.124156,Benzoate,

A,"Liang F, Lu M, Birch ME, Keener TC, Liu Z","The sulfur content of diesel fuel is of environmental concern because sulfur can facilitate the formation of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the exhaust can poison catalytic converters. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established more stringent regulations to reduce the sulfur content of diesel fuels in the near future. In this study, various types of organosulfur compounds in DPM extracts and the corresponding fuels have been determined by gas chromatography with atomic emission detection. The diesel fuels used have sulfur contents of 2284 and 433 ppm, respectively, and are labeled as high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuels. The compounds identified are mainly polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs). In the fuels tested, trimethylbenzothiophenes (TMBTs), dibenzothiophenes (DBTs), and 4-methyldibenzothiophene (4-MDBT) were the most abundant sulfur compounds, while larger PASH compounds were more abundant in DPM extracts. The high-sulfur diesel fuel contained a larger proportion of PASHs with one or two rings (lighter PASHs). In DPM, the concentrations of total organic sulfur and individual PASHs are higher for the high-sulfur diesel fuel, and the relative percentage of one or two-ring PASHs is higher as well. The influence of engine load on the DPM composition was also examined. With increasing load, the PASH concentration in DPM decreased for lighter PASHs, increased for heavier PASHs, and had a bell-shaped distribution for PASHs in between.",10.1016/j.chroma.2006.02.096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16574137,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.chroma.2006.02.096,Benzothiophene Desulfurization,

One atom of (18)O(2) was present in hydroquinone, resulting from the monooxygenation of bisphenol A and nonylphenol. The monooxygenase activity was dependent on both NADPH and flavin adenine dinucleotide. Various cytochrome P450 inhibitors had identical inhibition effects on the conversion of both xenobiotics. Using a mutant of Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP3, which is defective for growth on nonylphenol, we demonstrated that the reaction is catalyzed by the same enzymatic system. In conclusion, the degradation of bisphenol A and nonylphenol is initiated by the same monooxygenase, which may also lead to ipso substitution in other xenobiotics containing phenol with a quaternary alpha-carbon.",10.1128/AEM.00329-07,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17557840,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.00329-07,Bisphenol A,

These strains are the first 4-tert-butylphenol-utilizing bacteria. The strain designated TIK-1 completely degraded 1.0 mM 4-tert-butylphenol in basal salts medium within 12 h, with concomitant cell growth. We identified 4-tert-butylcatechol and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone as internal metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. When 3-fluorocatechol was used as an inactivator of meta-cleavage enzymes, strain TIK-1 could not degrade 4-tert-butylcatechol and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone was not detected. We concluded that metabolism of 4-tert-butylphenol by strain TIK-1 is initiated by hydroxylation to 4-tert-butylcatechol, followed by a meta-cleavage pathway. Growth experiments with 20 other alkylphenols showed that 4-isopropylphenol, 4-sec-butylphenol, and 4-tert-pentylphenol, which have alkyl side chains of three to five carbon atoms with α-quaternary or α-tertiary carbons, supported cell growth but that 4-n-alkylphenols, 4-tert-octylphenol, technical nonylphenol, 2-alkylphenols, and 3-alkylphenols did not. The rate of growth on 4-tert-butylphenol was much higher than that of growth on the other alkylphenols. Degradation experiments with various alkylphenols showed that strain TIK-1 cells grown on 4-tert-butylphenol could degrade 4-alkylphenols with variously sized and branched side chains (ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, tert-octyl, n-nonyl, and branched nonyl) via a meta-cleavage pathway but not 2- or 3-alkylphenols.

One of the isolates, designated Sphingobium yanoikuyae strain FM-2, at an initial cell density of 0.01 (optical density at 600 nm) completely degraded 0.5 mM BPF within 9 h without any lag period under inductive conditions. Degradation assays of various bisphenols revealed that the BPF-metabolizing system of strain FM-2 was effective only on the limited range of bisphenols consisting of two phenolic rings joined together through a bridging carbon without any methyl substitution on the rings or on the bridging structure. A BPF biodegradation pathway was proposed on the basis of metabolite production patterns and identification of the metabolites. The initial step of BPF biodegradation involves hydroxylation of the bridging carbon to form bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methanol, followed by oxidation to 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone. The 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone appears to be further oxidized by the Baeyer-Villiger reaction to 4-hydroxyphenyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, which is then cleaved by oxidation to form 4-hydroxybenzoate and 1,4-hydroquinone.

(strain ATCC 39723) degraded bromoxynil with the production of bromide and cyanide. No aromatic intermediates were detected in the spent culture fluid. The cyanide produced upon bromoxynil metabolism was inhibitory to the Flavobacterium sp. Whole cells degraded PCP more rapidly than they did bromoxynil. Bromoxynil metabolism and PCP metabolism were coinduced, either substrate serving as the inducer. Purified PCP hydroxylase degraded bromoxynil with stoichiometric accumulation of cyanide and without bromide production. A product accumulated which was more hydrophilic than bromoxynil upon high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis and which, when analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, had a mass spectrum consistent with that expected for dibromohydroquinone. PCP hydroxylase consumed NADPH, oxygen, and bromoxynil in a 2:1:1 molar ratio, producing 1 mol of cyanide per mol of bromoxynil degraded. We propose a pathway by which bromoxynil is metabolized by the same enzymes which degrade PCP. The initial step in the pathway is the conversion of bromoxynil to 2,6-dibromohydroquinone by PCP hydroxylase. In addition to its utility for decontaminating PCP-polluted sites, the Flavobacterium sp. may be useful for decontaminating bromoxynil spills.

Commonly occurring chloroaromatic fungal metabolites can end up in anaerobic microniches at the boundary of fungal colonies and wetland soils. The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental fate of a major fungal metabolite, 3, 5-dichloro-p-anisyl alcohol, under anaerobic conditions. This compound was incubated with methanogenic sludge to study its biotransformation reactions. Initially, 3,5-dichloro-p-anisyl alcohol was readily demethylated in stoichiometric quantities to 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol. The demethylated product was converted further via two routes: a biotic route leading to the formation of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate and 2,6-dichlorophenol, as well as an abiotic route leading to the formation of bis(3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)methane. In the first route, the benzyl alcohol moiety on the aromatic ring was oxidized, giving 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate as a transient or accumulating product, depending on the type of methanogenic sludge used. In sludge previously adapted to low-molecular-weight lignin from straw, a part of the 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate was decarboxylated, yielding detectable levels of 2,6-dichlorophenol. In the second route, 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dimerized, leading to the formation of a tetrachlorinated bisphenolic compound, which was identified as bis(3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)methane. Since formation of this dimer was also observed in incubations with autoclaved sludge spiked with 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, it was concluded that its formation was due to an abiotic process. However, demethylation of the fungal metabolite by biological processes was a prerequisite for dimerization. The most probable reaction mechanism leading to the formation of the tetrachlorinated dimer in the absence of oxygen is presented, and the possible environmental implications of its natural occurrence are discussed.",10.1128/AEM.64.9.3225-3231.1998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9726864,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.64.9.3225-3231.1998,Bromoxynil (an/aerobic),

Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee. The results of epidemiological research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure and plasma homocysteine. At present, there is little evidence that coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer. For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3-4 cups/d providing 300-400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. However, some groups, including people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine.

Coffee pulp or husk is a fibrous mucilagenous material (sub-product) obtained during the processing of coffee cherries by wet or dry process, respectively. Coffee pulp/husk contains some amount of caffeine and tannins, which makes it toxic in nature, resulting the disposal problem. However, it is rich in organic nature, which makes it an ideal substrate for microbial processes for the production of value-added products. Several solutions and alternative uses of the coffee pulp and husk have been attempted. These include as fertilizers, livestock feed, compost, etc. However, these applications utilize only a fraction of available quantity and are not technically very efficient. Attempts have been made to detoxify it for improved application as feed, and to produce several products such as enzymes, organic acids, flavour and aroma compounds, and mushrooms, etc. from coffee pulp/husk.

14977550,Catabolism of caffeine in plants and microorganisms.,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,Mazzafera P,"Caffeine has been found in tissues of several plants. Because of its stimulating effect on the central nervous system, a great number of reports have been published on its content in beverages and foodstuffs. However, a much more restricted number of reports have dealt specifically with caffeine metabolism in plants. This review presents, in chronological manner, the contribution of these reports to the vast knowledge accumulated on caffeine catabolism in plants and microorganisms over the last 40 years. In plants, the accumulated data indicate the operation of a main catabolic pathway: caffeine --> theophylline --> 3-methylxantine --> xanthine --> uric acid --> allantoin --> allantoic acid --> glyoxylic acid + urea --> NH3 + CO2. Some studies have shown that, depending on the plant species, other minor routes may operate with the formation of theobromine and 7-methylxantine, which are salvaged for caffeine formation since they also appear in the biosynthetic pathway. A specific group of coffee known as liberio-excelsioides has the ability to convert caffeine to the corresponding methyluric acid, which is methylated to other uric acid derivatives. In bacteria caffeine is either degraded to theobromine or paraxanthine. Both dimethylxanthines are demethylated to 7-methylxantine which in turn is demethylated to xanthine and then enters the catabolic pathway of purines. In bacteria, theobromine, paraxanthine and 7-methylxantine may also be oxidized to their corresponding methyluric acids.",10.2741/1339,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14977550,https://sci-hub.se/10.2741/1339,Caffeine (fungal),

This strain used not only caffeine, theobromine, paraxanthine, and 7-methylxanthine as sole carbon and nitrogen sources but also theophylline and 3-methylxanthine. Analyses of metabolites in spent media and resting cell suspensions confirmed that CBB5 initially N demethylated theophylline via a hitherto unreported pathway to 1- and 3-methylxanthines. NAD(P)H-dependent conversion of theophylline to 1- and 3-methylxanthines was also detected in the crude cell extracts of theophylline-grown CBB5. 1-Methylxanthine and 3-methylxanthine were subsequently N demethylated to xanthine. CBB5 also oxidized theophylline and 1- and 3-methylxanthines to 1,3-dimethyluric acid and 1- and 3-methyluric acids, respectively. However, these methyluric acids were not metabolized further. A broad-substrate-range xanthine-oxidizing enzyme was responsible for the formation of these methyluric acids. In contrast, CBB5 metabolized caffeine to theobromine (major metabolite) and paraxanthine (minor metabolite). These dimethylxanthines were further N demethylated to xanthine via 7-methylxanthine. Theobromine-, paraxanthine-, and 7-methylxanthine-grown cells also metabolized all of the methylxanthines mentioned above via the same pathway. Thus, the theophylline and caffeine N-demethylation pathways converged at xanthine via different methylxanthine intermediates. Xanthine was eventually oxidized to uric acid. Enzymes involved in theophylline and caffeine degradation were coexpressed when CBB5 was grown on theophylline or on caffeine or its metabolites. However, 3-methylxanthine-grown CBB5 cells did not metabolize caffeine, whereas theophylline was metabolized at much reduced levels to only methyluric acids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of theophylline N demethylation and coexpression of distinct pathways for caffeine and theophylline degradation in bacteria.",10.1128/JB.00409-09,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19447909,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.00409-09,Caffeine (fungal),

The enhancement by P addition did not occur if the medium also contained caprolactam and a caprolactam-utilizing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The suppression by the second bacterium was overcome by a higher P concentration. The rate of caprolactam utilization by P. aeruginosa was reduced if benzylamine and P. putida were also present in media with 100 nM P, but the suppression was absent if the solution contained a higher P concentration. Glutamate increased and inorganic N plus P decreased the length of the acclimation phase prior to benzylamine mineralization in lake water.

DNA sequence analysis of this 2.6-kb SmaI-SphI fragment revealed that there were three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, in this gene order). ORF1 and ORF2 were indispensable for meta-cleavage activity for 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol and its easily available analog, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, and were designated carBa and carBb, respectively. The alignment of CarBb with other meta-cleavage enzymes indicated that CarBb may have a non-heme iron cofactor coordinating site. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree, CarBb was classified as a member of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase family. This unique extradiol dioxygenase, CarB, had significantly higher affinity and about 20-times-higher meta-cleavage activity for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl than for catechol derivatives. The putative polypeptide encoded by ORF3 was homologous with meta-cleavage compound hydrolases in other bacteria, and ORF3 was designated carC. The hydrolase activity of CarC for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage compound of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, was 40 times higher than that for 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage compound of 3-methylcatechol. Alignment analysis and the phylogenetic tree indicate that CarC has greatest homologies with hydrolases involved in the monoaromatic compound degradation pathway.

A detailed study of the pathway of chlorophenol transformation showed that 3-chloro-, 4-chloro-, and 2,4-dichlorophenol were utilized by the strains via a modified ortho-pathway. 2-Chlorophenol and 2,3-dichlorophenol were transformed by strains R. opacus 1cp and R. rhodochrous 89 via corresponding 3-chloro- and 3,4-dichloropyrocatechols, which were then hydroxylated with the formation of 4-chloropyrogallol and 4,5-dichloropyrogallol; this route had not previously been described in bacteria. Phenol hydroxylase of R. opacus 1G exhibited a previously undescribed catalytic pattern, catalyzing oxidative dehalogenation of 2,3,5-trichlorophenol with the formation of 3,5-dichloropyrocatechol but not hydroxylation of the nonsubstituted position 6.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10808489,,Chlorobenzene,

Due to its widespread industrial use, chromium (Cr) has become a serious pollutant in diverse environmental settings. The hexavalent form of the metal, Cr(VI), is considered a more toxic species than the relatively innocuous and less mobile Cr(III) form. The presence of Cr in the environment has selected microbial and plant variants able to tolerate high levels of Cr compounds. The diverse Cr-resistance mechanisms displayed by microorganisms, and probably by plants, include biosorption, diminished accumulation, precipitation, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and chromate efflux.

This cluster maps at min 57.5 of the chromosome and is composed of five catabolic genes arranged as a putative operon (hcaA1A2CBD) and two additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction that encode a potential permease (hcaT) and a regulator (hcaR). Sequence comparisons revealed that while hcaA1A2CD genes encode the four subunits of the 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase, the hcaB gene codes for the corresponding cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. This type of catabolic module is homologous to those encoding class IIB dioxygenases and becomes the first example of such a catabolic cluster in E. coli. The inducible expression of the hca genes requires the presence of the hcaR gene product, which acts as a transcriptional activator and shows significant sequence similarity to members of the LysR family of regulators. Interestingly, the HcaA1A2CD and HcaB enzymes are able to oxidize not only PP to 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) but also cinnamic acid (CI) to its corresponding 2, 3-dihydroxy derivative. Further catabolism of DHPP requires the mhp-encoded meta fission pathway for the mineralization of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP) (A. Ferrández, J. L. García, and E. Díaz, J. Bacteriol. 179:2573-2581, 1997). Expression in Salmonella typhimurium of the mhp genes alone or in combination with the hca cluster allowed the growth of the recombinant bacteria in 3-hydroxycinnamic acid (3HCI) and CI, respectively. Thus, the convergent mhp- and hca-encoded pathways are also functional in S. typhimurium, and they are responsible for the catabolism of different phenylpropanoid compounds (3HPP, 3HCI, PP, and CI) widely available in nature.",10.1128/JB.180.11.2915-2923.1998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9603882,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.180.11.2915-2923.1998,Cinnamate,

One mutant was unable to utilize geraniol but showed wild-type growth with the three other acyclic terpenes tested. The Tn5 insertion site of the mutant was determined by DNA sequencing. Comparison with the P. aeruginosa genome sequence revealed that PA3028, an ORF with high similarity on the amino acid level to molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A2 (encoded by moeA2), was the target of mini-Tn5 in the mutant. Disruption of moeA2 in P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type by insertion mutagenesis resulted in the same geraniol-minus phenotype. The ability to utilize geraniol was restored to the mutant by conjugative transfer of PCR-cloned wild-type moeA2 on a broad-host-range plasmid. Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on geraniol and geranial, but not on citronellol, citronellate or geranylate, was inhibited by the presence of 10 mM tungstate, a molybdenum-specific inhibitor. Inhibition by tungstate was prevented by addition of molybdate. The results indicate that at least one step in the oxidation of geraniol to geranic acid (geranial oxidation) is a molybdenum-dependent reaction in P. aeruginosa and is different from the molybdenum-independent oxidation of citronellol to citronellate.",10.1099/mic.0.27957-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16000717,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/mic.0.27957-0,Citronellol,

A liu (leucine and isovalerate utilization) homolog cluster was found in the PAO1 genome and is related to the catabolism of acyclic monoterpenes of the citronellol family (AMTC); it was named the atu cluster (acyclic terpene utilization), consisting of the atuCDEF genes and lacking the hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) lyase (HMG-CoA lyase) homolog. Mutagenesis of the atu and liu clusters showed that both are involved in AMTC and leucine catabolism by encoding the enzymes related to the geranyl-CoA and the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA pathways, respectively. Intermediary metabolites of the acyclic monoterpene pathway, citronellic and geranic acids, were accumulated, and leucine degradation rates were affected in both atuF and liuD mutants. The alpha subunit of geranyl-CoA carboxylase and the alpha subunit of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (alpha-MCCase), encoded by the atuF and liuD genes, respectively, were both induced by citronellol, whereas only the alpha-MCCase subunit was induced by leucine. Both citronellol and leucine also induced a LacZ transcriptional fusion at the liuB gene. The liuE gene encodes a probable hydroxy-acyl-CoA lyase (probably HMG-CoA lyase), an enzyme with bifunctional activity that is essential for both AMTC and leucine degradation.

Over a 25-year period, a number of original research papers and reviews have stated that cyanuric acid is metabolized in two steps to the 2-nitrogen intermediate urea. In the present study, allophanate, not urea, was shown to be the 2-nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism in all the bacteria examined. Six different experimental results supported this conclusion: (i) synthetic allophanate was shown to readily decarboxylate to form urea under acidic extraction and chromatography conditions used in previous studies; (ii) alkaline extraction methods were used to stabilize and detect allophanate in bacteria actively metabolizing cyanuric acid; (iii) the kinetic course of allophanate formation and disappearance was consistent with its being an intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism, and no urea was observed in those experiments; (iv) protein extracts from cells grown on cyanuric acid contained allophanate hydrolase activity; (v) genes encoding the enzymes AtzE and AtzF, which produce and hydrolyze allophanate, respectively, were found in several cyanuric acid-metabolizing bacteria; and (vi) TrzF, an AtzF homolog found in Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to have allophanate hydrolase activity. In addition, we have observed that there are a large number of genes homologous to atzF and trzF distributed in phylogenetically distinct bacteria.

One gene cluster (8 kb) encodes the subunits of a multicomponent hydroxylase related to the soluble butane of Pseudomonas butanovora and methane monooxygenases (sMMO) of methanotrophs. We propose that this butane monooxygenase homologue carries out the oxidation of cyclohexane into cyclohexanol during growth.

In vitro oxidation of ethylene (an alternative substrate for sBMO) was reconstituted in the soluble portion of cell extracts and was NADH-dependent. Butane monooxygenase was separated into three components which were obligately required for substrate oxidation. The N-terminal sequences of the peptides associated with butane monooxygenase led to the cloning and sequencing of the 5797 nucleotide bmo gene cluster. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences with other multicomponent monooxygenases suggest that sBMO is a multimeric hydroxylase with 61, 45 and 19 kDa subunits encoded by bmoXYZ, a 40 kDa oxidoreductase encoded by bmoC, and a 15 kDa regulatory protein encoded by bmoB. A sixth structural gene (bmoD) encodes a 9.6 kDa protein with similarity exclusively to mmoD (orfY), a putative metal centre assembly protein of the soluble methane monooxygenases. Insertional inactivation of bmoX resulted in a mutant 'P. butanovora' strain incapable of growth with butane. A putative promoter element characteristic of promoters associated with sigma(54)-dependent transcription initiation was located upstream of the bmo genes. Expression of all six genes was detected in butane-induced cells. Butane monooxygenase from 'P. butanovora' aligns most closely with non-haem carboxylate-bridged diiron monooxygenases and, moreover, contains the characteristic iron-binding motif.

The purified enzyme was homogeneous in disc electrophoresis, and the molecular weight was found to be approximately 80,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme catalyzed the following reaction: cyclohexylamine+O2+H2O leads to cyclohexanone+NH3+H2O2. The enzyme thus can be classified as an amine oxidase; it utilized oxygen as the ultimate electron acceptor. The pH optimum of the reaction was 6.8 and the apparent Km value for cyclohexylamine was 2.5 X 10(-4) M. The enzyme was highly specific for the deamination of alicyclic primary amines such as cyclohexylamine, but was found to be inactive toward ordinary amines used as substrates for amine oxidases. The enzyme solution was yellow in color and showed a typical flavoprotein spectrum; the addition of cyclohexylamine under anaerobic conditions caused reduction of the flavin in the native enzyme. The flavin of the prosthetic group was identified as FAD by thin layer chromatography. The participation of sulfhydryl groups in the enzymic action was also suggested by the observation that the enzyme activity was inhibited in the presence of PCMB and could be recovered by the addition of glutathione.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a131549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18451,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a131549,Cyclohexylsulfamate,

Explantation of their differences in toxicity depends on examination of all factors of their comparative toxicology. Routes of exposure are important, as are metabolism and elimination rates, especially for mammals and birds with their considerable capabilities for biotransformation. Significant differences in sensitivity at the sites of toxic action may also play a role in differential responses to these insecticides.

Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters. Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan. A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides.

The isolate grew with both the biaryl ethers dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (DF) as the sole sources of carbon and energy, showing doubling times of about 8 and 5 h, respectively. Biodegradation of the two aromatic compounds initially proceeded after an oxygenolytic attack at the angular position adjacent to the ether bridge, producing 2,2',3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether or 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl from the initially formed dihydrodiols, which represent extremely unstable hemiacetals. Results obtained from determinations of enzyme activities and oxygen consumption suggest meta cleavage of the trihydroxy compounds. During dibenzofuran degradation, hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoate yielded salicylate, which was branched into the catechol meta cleavage pathway and the gentisate pathway.

We purified this dibenzofuran 4,4a-dioxygenase system (DBFDOS) and found it to consist of four components which catalyzed three activities. Two isofunctional, monomeric flavoproteins (components A1 and A2; M(r) of about 44,000) transferred electrons from NADH to the second component (B; M(r) of about 12,000), a ferredoxin, which transported electrons to the heteromultimeric (alpha 2 beta 2) oxygenase component (C; M(r) of alpha, 45,000; M(r) of beta, 23,000). DBFDOS consumed 1 mol each of NADH, O2, and DBF, which was dioxygenated to about 1 mol of THB; no intermediate was observed. The reaction was thus the dioxygenation of DBF at the 4 and 4a positions to give a diene-diol-hemiacetal which rearomatized by spontaneous loss of a phenolate group to form THB. Components A1 and A2 each reduced dichlorophenolindophenol but had negligible activity with cytochrome c; each lost the yellow color, observed to be flavin adenine dinucleotide, upon purification. Component B, which transported electrons to the oxygenase or cytochrome c, had an N-terminal amino acid sequence with high homology to the putidaredoxin of cytochrome P-450cam.

Nine open reading frames were identified and designated doxABDEFGHIJ. Collectively, we refer to these genes as the DOX pathway. At the nucleotide level, doxABD are identical to the ndoABC genes that encode naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida. The DoxG protein is 97% identical to NahC (1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase) of P. putida. DoxE has 37% identity with cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. DoxF is similar to the aldehyde dehydrogenases of many organisms. The predicted DoxHIJ proteins have no obvious sequence similarities to known proteins. Gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and mass spectroscopy confirmed that the DOX proteins convert naphthalene to salicylate and converting phenanthrene to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. doxI mutants convert naphthalene to trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate, indicating that the DoxI protein is similar to NahE (trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase). Comparison of the DOX sequence with restriction maps of cloned naphthalene catabolic pathway (NAH) genes revealed many conserved restriction sites.

These studies included investigations of vertical and horizontal variability in degradation rates from the vadose zone to an aquifer, the effects of aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and the importance of concentration on degradation kinetics for a selected range of herbicides. The studies were based on different experimental approaches ranging from simple batch experiments to column studies to field injection experiments and, where appropriate, results were compared. Some herbicides were degraded under aerobic conditions (some phenoxy acids, DNOC and glyphosate) and others under aerobic conditions (other phenoxy acids, DNOC; there was some indication of atrazine transformation). Certain pesticides were not degraded in any investigations (dichlobenil, the dichlobenil metabolite 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), bentazone, isoproturon, metamitron and metsulfuron-methyl). The spatial variability was substantial, since hardly any of the investigated pesticides were degraded in all comparable samples. This means that it is very difficult to claim that a given pesticide is readily degradable in aquifers.

Given this constraint, a systematic examination of in vivo C-P lyase activity has been conducted to develop insight into the C-P cleavage reaction. Six bacterial strains were obtained by enrichment culture, identified, and characterized with respect to their phosphonic acid substrate specificity. One isolate, Agrobacterium radiobacter, was shown to cleave the carbon-phosphorus bond of a wide range of substrates, including fosfomycin, glyphosate, and dialkyl phosphinic acids. Furthermore, this organism processed vinyl-, propenyl-, and propynylphosphonic acids, a previously uninvestigated group, to ethylene, propene, and propyne, respectively. A determination of product stoichiometries revealed that both C-P bonds of dimethylphosphinic acid are cleaved quantitatively to methane and, furthermore, that the extent of C-P bond cleavage correlated linearly with the specific growth rate for a range of substrates. The broad substrate specificity of Agrobacterium C-P lyase and the comprehensive characterization of the in vivo activity make this an attractive system for further biochemical and mechanistic experiments.

In this paper we report the nucleotide sequence of a 4592 bp region of the alkBFGHJKL operon encoding the AlkJ, AlkK and AlkL polypeptides. The alkJ gene encodes a protein of 59 kilodaltons. The predicted amino acid sequence shows significant homology with four flavin proteins: choline dehydrogenase, a glucose dehydrogenase and two oxidases. AlkJ is membrane-bound and converts aliphatic medium-chain-length alcohols into aldehydes. The properties of AlkJ suggest that it is linked to the electron transfer chain. AlkJ is necessary for growth on alkanes only in P. putida alcohol dehydrogenase (AlcA) mutants. AlkK is homologous to a range of proteins which act by an ATP-dependent covalent binding of AMP to their substrate. This list includes the acetate, coumarate and long-chain fatty acid CoA ligases. The alkK gene complements a fadD mutation in Escherichia coli, which shows that it indeed encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase. AlkK is a 60 kilodalton protein located in the cytoplasm. AlkL is homologous to OmpW, a Vibrio cholerae outer membrane protein of unknown function, and a hypothetical polypeptide encoded by ytt4 in E. coli. AlkL, OmpW and Ytt4 all have a signal peptide and end with a sequence characteristic of outer membrane proteins.

Microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove such toxicants from the environment. This study reports the isolation of highly efficient endosulfan degrading bacterial strains from soil. A total of 29 bacterial strains were isolated through enrichment technique from 15 specific sites using endosulfan as sole sulfur source. The strains differed substantially in their potential to degrade endosulfan in vitro ranging from 40 to 93% of the spiked amount (100 mg l(-1)). During the initial 3 days of incubation, there was very little degradation but it got accelerated as the incubation period proceeded. Biodegradation of endosulfan by these bacteria also resulted in substantial decrease in pH of the broth from 8.2 to 3.7 within 14 days of incubation. The utilization of endosulfan was accompanied by increased optical densities (OD(595)) of the broth ranging from 0.511 to 0.890. High performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that endosulfan diol and endosulfan ether were among the products of endosulfan metabolism by these bacterial strains while endosulfan sulfate, a persistent and toxic metabolite of endosulfan, was not detected in any case. The presence of endosulfan diol and endosulfan ether in the bacterial metabolites was further confirmed by GC-MS. Abiotic degradation contributed up to 21% of the spiked amount. The three bacterial strains, Pseudomonas spinosa, P. aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia, were the most efficient degraders of both alpha- and beta-endosulfan as they consumed more than 90% of the spiked amount (100 mg l(-1)) in the broth within 14 days of incubation.

Two Anabaena species, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Anabaena flos-aquae, were used in this study. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 produced three principal biotransformation compounds, chiefly endosulfan diol (endodiol), and minor amounts of endosulfan hydroxyether and endosulfan lactone. Trace amounts of endosulfan sulfate were detected. In comparison, the biotransformation of endosulfan by Anabaena flos-aquae yielded mainly endodiol with minor amounts of endosulfan sulfate. An unknown compound was produced up to 70% from endosulfan spiked in the medium inoculated by A. flos-aquae after 8 days of incubation. Therefore, the endosulfan fate was dependent on the species. Within 1 day of incubation, two Anabaena species produced low amounts of beta-endosulfan after application of alpha-endosulfan. These results suggest the presence of isomerase in the Anabaena species.

The persistent product endosulfan sulfate was generated in all cases; however, its yield was approximately a factor of three higher from alpha-endosulfan relative to beta-endosulfan. Beta-endosulfan hydrolyzed faster than alpha-endosulfan to endosulfan diol, which then rapidly degraded to endosulfan ether, endosulfan alpha-hydroxyether (major product), and endosulfan lactone. The ring-opened form of the lactone, endosulfan gamma-hydroxycarboxylate, is reported for the first time; it appears to be a terminal product, at least over the timescale of the experiment. The equilibrium between endosulfan gamma-hydroxycarboxylate and endosulfan lactone is dependent on pH, as only the protonated form of the gamma-hydroxy acid undergoes ring-closure. The pKa of the gamma-hydroxy acid was determined to be 5.7, implying that the lactone will quickly open and deprontonate under environmentally relevant conditions.",10.1039/b212165d,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12833978,https://sci-hub.se/10.1039/b212165d,Endosulfan,

Xylene and nitrotoluene isomers were also oxidized to substituted benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde derivatives. NDO oxidized ethylbenzene sequentially through (S)-1-phenethyl alcohol (77% enantiomeric excess) and acetophenone to 2-hydroxyacetophenone. In addition, NDO also oxidized ethylbenzene through styrene to (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (74% enantiomeric excess) by reactions involving desaturation and dihydroxylation, respectively. Isotope experiments with 18O2, H2 18O, and D2O suggest that 1-phenethyl alcohol is oxidized to acetophenone by a minor reaction involving desaturation followed by tautomerization. The major reaction in the conversion of 1-phenethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol to acetophenone and benzaldehyde, respectively, probably involves monohydroxylation to form a gem-diol intermediate which stereospecifically loses the incoming hydroxyl group to leave the carbonyl product.

Two new denitrifying strains, EbN1 and PbN1, were isolated on ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene, respectively. For comparison, two further denitrifying strains, ToN1 and mXyN1, were isolated from the same mud with toluene and m-xylene, respectively. Sequencing of 16SrDNA revealed a close relationship of the new isolates to Thauera selenatis. The strains exhibited different specific capacities for degradation of alkylbenzenes. In addition to ethylbenzene, strain EbN1 utilized toluene, but not propylbenzene. In contrast, propylbenzene-degrading strain PbN1 did not grow on toluene, but was able to utilize ethylbenzene. Strain ToN1 used toluene as the only hydrocarbon substrate, whereas strain mXyN1 utilized both toluene and m-xylene. Measurement of the degradation balance demonstrated complete oxidation of ethylbenzene to CO2 by strain EbN1. Further characteristic substrates of strains EbN1 and PbN1 were 1-phenylethanol and acetophenone. In contrast to the other isolates, stain mXyN1 did not grow on benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol (also m-methyl-benzyl alcohol) was even a specific inhibitor of toluene and m-xylene utilization by strain mXyN1.

20047908,ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetophenone by a novel type of carboxylase.,Journal of bacteriology,"Jobst B, Schühle K, Linne U, Heider J","Anaerobic ethylbenzene metabolism in the betaproteobacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum is initiated by anaerobic oxidation to acetophenone via (S)-1-phenylethanol. The subsequent carboxylation of acetophenone to benzoylacetate is catalyzed by an acetophenone-induced enzyme, which has been purified and studied. The same enzyme is involved in acetophenone metabolism in the absence of ethylbenzene. Acetophenone carboxylase consists of five subunits with molecular masses of 70, 15, 87, 75, and 34 kDa, whose genes (apcABCDE) form an apparent operon. The enzyme is synthesized at high levels in cells grown on ethylbenzene or acetophenone, but not in cells grown on benzoate. During purification, acetophenone carboxylase dissociates into inactive subcomplexes consisting of the 70-, 15-, 87-, and 75-kDa subunits (apcABCD gene products) and the 34-kDa subunit (apcE gene product), respectively. Acetophenone carboxylase activity was restored by mixing the purified subcomplexes. The enzyme contains 1 Zn(2+) ion per alphabetagammadelta core complex and is dependent on the presence of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). In spite of the presence of Zn in the enzyme, it is strongly inhibited by Zn(2+) ions. Carboxylation of acetophenone is dependent on ATP hydrolysis to ADP and P(i), exhibiting a stoichiometry of 2 mol ATP per mol acetophenone carboxylated. The enzyme shows uncoupled ATPase activity with either bicarbonate or acetophenone in the absence of the second substrate. These observations indicate that both substrates may be phosphorylated, which is consistent with isotope exchange activity observed with deuterated acetophenone and inhibition by carbamoylphosphate, a structural analogue of carboxyphosphate. A potential mechanism of ATP-dependent acetophenone carboxylation is suggested.",10.1128/JB.01423-09,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20047908,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.01423-09,Ethylbenzene (anaerobic),

Washed-cell suspensions of strain F101 with fluorene accumulated 9-fluorenone, 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone, 3-hydroxy-1-indanone, 1-indanone, 2-indanone, 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, and a compound tentatively identified as a formyl indanone. Incubations with 2-indanone produced 3-isochromanone. The growth yield with fluorene as a sole source of carbon and energy corresponded to an assimilation of about 34% of fluorene carbon. About 7.4% was transformed into 9-fluorenol, 9-fluorenone, and 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone. Crude extracts from fluorene-induced cells showed 3,4-dihydrocoumarin hydrolase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities. These results and biodegradation experiments with the identified metabolites indicate that metabolism of fluorene by Arthrobacter sp. strain F101 proceeds through three independent pathways. Two productive routes are initiated by dioxygenation at positions 1,2 and 3,4, respectively. meta cleavage followed by an aldolase reaction and loss of C-1 yield the detected indanones. Subsequent biological Baeyer-Villiger reactions produce the aromatic lactones 3,4-dihydrocoumarin and 3-isochromanone. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the former gives 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, which could be a substrate for a beta oxidation cycle, to give salicylate. Further oxidation of the latter via catechol and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde connects with the central metabolism, allowing the utilization of all fluorene carbons. Identification of 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone is consistent with an alternative pathway initiated by monooxygenation at C-9 to give 9-fluorenol and then 9-fluorenone. Although dioxygenation at 3,4 positions of the ketone apparently occurs, this reaction fails to furnish a subsequent productive oxidation of this compound.",10.1128/aem.63.3.819-826.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9055403,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.63.3.819-826.1997,Fluorene,

The oxygen atoms in 1-indenol and cis-1,2-indandiol were shown to be derived from molecular oxygen, whereas 70% of the oxygen in 1-indanol was derived from water. All of the isolated products were optically active as demonstrated by 19F NMR and HPLC discrimination of diastereomeric esters and by chiroptic methods. The high optical purity of (-)-(1R)-indanol (84% enantiomeric excess) and the failure of scavengers of reactive oxygen species to inhibit the monooxygenation reaction supported the contention that the monooxygen insertion is mediated by an active-site process. Experiments with 3-[2H]indene indicated that equilibration between C-1 and C-3 occurred prior to the formation of the carbon-oxygen bond to yield 1-indenol. Naphthalene dioxygenase also oxidized indan to 1-indanol, which suggested that benzylic monoxygenation may be typical of this group of dioxygenases.",10.1021/bi00404a041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3365392,https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/bi00404a041,Fluorene,

The remaining hypothetical proteins displayed only limited similarity with enzyme sequences available from databases.

The apo-HppE from Streptomyces wedmorensis is colorless, but turns green with broad absorption bands at 430 and 680 nm after reconstitution with ferrous ion under aerobic conditions. Resonance Raman studies showed that this green chromophore arises from a bidentate iron(III)-catecholate (DOPA) complex, and the most likely site of modification is at Tyr105 on the basis of site-specific mutagenesis results. It was also found that reconstitution in the presence of ascorbate leads to the formation of additional DOPA that shows (18)O-incorporation from (18)O(2). Thus, HppE can act as an oxygenase via a putative high valent iron-oxo or an iron-hydroperoxo intermediate, just like other members of the family of non-heme iron enzymes.

This sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio strain B is an incomplete oxidizer, unable to carry out the terminal oxidation of organic substrates, leaving acetic acid as the end product. Introduction of acetate-utilizing methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri 227 converted acetic acid to methane. This well-defined mixed consortium used furfural as its sole source of carbon and converted it to methane and CO(2). In the mixed culture, when a methanogen inhibitor was used in the culture medium, furfural was converted to acetic acid by the Desulfovibrio strain B, but acetic acid did not undergo further metabolism. On the other hand, when the growth of Desulfovibrio in the consortium was suppressed with a specific SRB inhibitor, namely molybdate, furfural was not degraded.

It has a native molecular mass of 135 kDa, determined by gel filtration, and subunit molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa, determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis, indicating the holoenzyme is a dimer of two similar if not identical subunits. The enzyme shows strong activity from pH 4 to 8 (optimum pH 7.0), relatively high temperature tolerance (50-55 degrees C), and an apparent Km and Vmax for furfural of 1.5x10(-4)M and 28.5 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively.

This labeling was used as a reporter to purify both labile proteins. The radioactivity cochromatographed predominantly with the residual enzymatic activity of both enzymes during the first purification steps. Both radioactive proteins were separated and purified to homogeneity. Antibodies raised against the larger protein also exhibited cross-reactivity toward the second smaller protein and removed xanthine dehydrogenase and 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity up to 80 and 60% from the supernatant of cell extracts, respectively. With use of cell extract, Western immunoblots showed only two bands which correlated exactly with the activity stains for both enzymes after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molybdate was absolutely required for incorporation of 185W, formation of cross-reacting material, and enzymatic activity. The latter parameters showed a perfect correlation. This evidence proves that the radioactive proteins were actually xanthine dehydrogenase and 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The apparent molecular weight of the native xanthine dehydrogenase was about 300,000, and that of 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase was 150,000.

Pyrogallol consumption by resting cells stopped after lysis by French press or mild detergent (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB]) treatment. Addition of 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene to the assay mixture restored pyrogallol consumption and led to stoichiometric phloroglucinol accumulation. The stoichiometry of pyrogallol conversion to phloroglucinol was independent of the amount of tetrahydroxybenzene added. The tetrahydroxybenzene concentration limited the velocity of the transhydroxylation reaction, which reached a maximum at 1.5 mM tetrahydroxybenzene (1 U/mg of protein). Transhydroxylation was shown to be reversible. The equilibrium constant of the reaction was determined, and the free-energy change (delta G degree') of phloroglucinol formation from pyrogallol was calculated to be -15.5 kJ/mol. Permeabilized cells and cell extracts also catalyzed the transfer of hydroxyl moieties between other hydroxylated benzenes. Tetrahydroxybenzene and hydroxyhydroquinone participated as hydroxyl donors and as hydroxyl acceptors in the reaction, whereas pyrogallol, resorcinol, and phloroglucinol were hydroxylated by both donors. A novel mechanism deduced from these data involves intermolecular transfer of the hydroxyl moiety from the cosubstrate (1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene) to the substrate (pyrogallol), thus forming the product (phloroglucinol) and regenerating the cosubstrate.",10.1128/jb.172.2.1070-1076.1990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2298693,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.172.2.1070-1076.1990,Gallate (anaerobic),

In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis, sensitivity to isoprenols is reduced by prior induction of the isoprenoid degradative pathway via either growth on succinate in the presence of citronellol or growth on citronellic acid. For this species, citronellic acid proved to be the best isoprenoid growth substrate tested. Geraniol utilization as a taxonomic indicator for different subgroups of pseudomonads is discussed. Only a few of the species tested were able to utilize acyclic isoprenoids.

One mutant was unable to utilize geraniol but showed wild-type growth with the three other acyclic terpenes tested. The Tn5 insertion site of the mutant was determined by DNA sequencing. Comparison with the P. aeruginosa genome sequence revealed that PA3028, an ORF with high similarity on the amino acid level to molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A2 (encoded by moeA2), was the target of mini-Tn5 in the mutant. Disruption of moeA2 in P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type by insertion mutagenesis resulted in the same geraniol-minus phenotype. The ability to utilize geraniol was restored to the mutant by conjugative transfer of PCR-cloned wild-type moeA2 on a broad-host-range plasmid. Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on geraniol and geranial, but not on citronellol, citronellate or geranylate, was inhibited by the presence of 10 mM tungstate, a molybdenum-specific inhibitor.

For phosphonate xenobiotics, the enzyme system responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus bond has not yet been observed in vitro, though much is understood on a genetic level about phosphonate degradation. Phosphonate metabolism is regulated as part of the Pho regulon, under phosphate starvation control. For organophosphorothionate pesticides the situation is not so clear, and the mode of regulation appears to depend on whether the compounds are utilized to provide phosphorus, carbon or sulfur for cell growth. The same is true for organosulfonate metabolism, where different (and differently regulated) enzymatic pathways are involved in the utilization of sulfonates as carbon and as sulfur sources, respectively. Observations at the protein level in a number of bacteria suggest that a regulatory system is present which responds to sulfate limitation and controls the synthesis of proteins involved in providing sulfur to the cell and which may reveal analogies between the regulation of phosphorus and sulfur metabolism.",10.1111/j.1574-6976.1994.tb00135.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7946467,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1574-6976.1994.tb00135.x,Glyphosate,

The results indicate that the absorbance change previously attributed to changes in the environment of the FAD of ETF upon binding to TMADH is instead caused by electron transfer from partially reduced, as-isolated TMADH to ETF. Prior treatment of the as-isolated enzyme with the oxidant ferricenium essentially abolishes the observed spectral change. Further, when the semiquinone form of ETF is used instead of the oxidized form, the mirror image of the spectral change seen with as-isolated TMADH and oxidized ETF is observed. This is attributable to a small amount of electron transfer in the reverse of the physiological direction.

Microbial enzymes, either in their native or heterologous hosts, are a powerful and low-cost tool for eliminating this environmental hazard. As many explosives have only been present in the environment for 10 years, and with similar molecules not known in Nature, the origin of enzymes specialized for the breakdown of explosives is of particular interest. Screening of environmental isolates resulted in the discovery of flavoproteins capable of denitrating the explosives pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and glycerol trinitrate. These nitrate ester reductases are related in sequence and structure to Old Yellow Enzyme from Saccharomyces carlsbergenisis. All the members of this family have alpha/beta barrel structures and FMN as a prosthetic group, and reduce various electrophilic substrates. The nitrate ester reductases are, however, unusual in that they display activity towards the highly recalcitrant, aromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, via a reductive pathway resulting in nitrogen liberation.

When we incubated the soil with strain DN22, both RDX and MNX (but not HMX) degraded and produced NDAB (388 +/- 22 micromol kg(-1)) in 5 days. Subsequent incubation of the soil with the fungus led to the removal of NDAB, with the liberation of nitrous oxide (N2O). In cultures with the fungus alone NDAB degraded to give a stoichiometric amount of N2O.

Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that hypophosphite:2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (HtxA) is a novel member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme family. To provide experimental support for this hypothesis, HtxA was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Recombinant HtxA is identical to the native enzyme based on amino terminus sequencing and mass spectral analysis, and it catalyzes the oxidation of hypophosphite to phosphite in a process strictly dependent on 2-oxoglutarate, ferrous ions, and oxygen. Succinate and phosphite are stoichiometrically produced, indicating a strict coupling of the reaction. Size exclusion analysis suggests that HtxA is active as a homodimer, and maximal activity is observed at pH 7.0 and at 27 degrees C.

The second, smaller domain folds into an alpha+beta domain, related in topology to chorismate mutase by a circular permutation. IDS epimerase is thus not related in three-dimensional structure to other known epimerases. The fold of the IDS epimerase is representative for the whole MmgE/PrpD family. The putative active site is located at the interface between the two domains of the subunit, and is characterized by a positively charged surface, consistent with the binding of a highly negatively charged substrate such as iminodisuccinate.

SLRS7 cleaves two of three isomers of iminodisuccinate.,Biodegradation,"Cokesa Z, Lakner S, Knackmuss HJ, Rieger PG","Following biodegradation tests according to the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals 301F different degradation rates were observed for the three stereoisomers of iminodisuccinate (IDS). A strain was isolated from activated sludge, which used two of three isomers, R,S-IDS and S,S-IDS, as sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. The isolated strain was identified by 16S-rDNA and referred to as Ralstonia sp. SLRS7. An IDS-degrading lyase was isolated from the cell-free extract. The enzyme was purified by three chromatographic steps, which included anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration. The lyase catalysed the non-hydrolytic cleavage of IDS without requirement of any cofactors. Cleavage of S,S-IDS led to the formation of fumaric acid and L-aspartic acid. Interestingly R,S-IDS yielded only D-aspartic acid besides fumaric acid. R,R-IDS was not transformed. Thus, the IDS-degrading enzyme is a carbon-nitrogen lyase attacking only the asymmetric carbon atom exhibiting the S-configuration. Besides S,S-IDS and R,S-IDS cleavage, the lyase catalysed also the transformation of certain S,S-IDS metal complexes, namely Ca(2+)-, Mg(2+)- and Mn(2+)-IDS. The maximum enzyme activity was found at pH 8.0-8.5 and 35 degrees C. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a single 57-kDa protein band.

We also observed that a specific scavenger of NO* provided protection against the antimycobacterial activity of INH in bacterial culture.

There is evidence that the INH metabolite hydrazine plays an important role in the mechanism of this toxicity. Metabolism of INH leads to the production of hydrazine via both direct and indirect pathways. In both cases, the activity of an INH amidase is required to hydrolyze an amide bond. In the present study, using a model of INH-induced hepatotoxicity in rabbits, pretreatment of rabbits with the amidase inhibitor bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate 30 min before injection of INH inhibited the formation of INH-derived hydrazine and decreased measures of hepatocellular damage, hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and hypertriglyceridemia. Bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate also potently inhibited the production of hydrazine from INH in in vitro microsomal incubations (IC50 2 microM). Although hepatic glutathione stores are decreased, they are not depleted in animals with INH-induced hepatotoxicity. Significant effects on hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 1A1/2 and cytochrome P-450 2E1 activities suggest that these isozymes may be involved in the mechanism of the toxicity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of amidase activity in this rabbit model of hepatotoxicity and provides additional evidence in support of the role of hydrazine in the mechanism of INH-induced hepatotoxicity.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10215642,,Isoniazid,

In this study, katG of M. bovis BCG was separated and purified into two katGs, katG I (named as relatively higher molecular weight than katG II) and katG II, indicating that there is some difference in protein structure between two katGs. The molecular weight of the enzymes of katG I and katG II was estimated to be approximately 150,000 Da by gel filtration, and its subunit was 75,000 Da as determined by SDS-PAGE, indicating that purified enzyme was composed of two identical subunits. The specific activity of the purified enzyme katG I was 991.1 (units/mg). The enzymes were then investigated in INH activation by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

This isolate, the first isolate with this capacity to be characterized, was identified by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, and 100% sequence identity with a reference strain of Mycobacterium austroafricanum was found. Mycobacterium sp. strain IFP 2173 used an unusually wide spectrum of hydrocarbons as growth substrates, including n-alkanes and multimethyl-substituted isoalkanes with chains ranging from 5 to 16 carbon atoms long, as well as substituted monoaromatic hydrocarbons. It also attacked ethers, such as methyl t-butyl ether. During growth on gasoline, it degraded 86% of the substrate. Our results indicated that strain IFP 2173 was capable of degrading 3-methyl groups, possibly by a carboxylation and deacetylation mechanism.

Strain SRS2 was able to mineralize IPU when provided as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Supplementing the medium with a mixture of amino acids considerably enhanced IPU mineralization. Mineralization of IPU was accompanied by transient accumulation of the metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, and 4-isopropyl-aniline identified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, thus indicating a metabolic pathway initiated by two successive N-demethylations, followed by cleavage of the urea side chain and finally by mineralization of the phenyl structure.

Both members of this consortium were isolated from a highly enriched isoproturon-degrading culture derived from an agricultural soil previously treated regularly with the herbicide. Based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, strain SRS1 was assigned to the beta-subdivision of the proteobacteria and probably represents a new genus. Strain SRS1 was unable to degrade either isoproturon or its known metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, or 4-isopropyl-aniline. Pure culture studies indicate that Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 is auxotrophic and requires components supplied by association with other soil bacteria. A specific mixture of amino acids appeared to meet these requirements, and it was shown that methionine was essential for Sphingomonas sp. SRS2. This suggests that strain SRS1 supplies amino acids to Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, thereby leading to rapid metabolism of (14)C-labeled isoproturon to (14)CO(2) and corresponding growth of strain SRS2. Proliferation of strain SRS1 suggests that isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 provides unknown metabolites or cell debris that supports growth of strain SRS1.

Ketoprofen was partly mineralized as a sole source of carbon and energy and the metabolites determined by LC-MS suggest microbial ketoprofen degradation to proceed along the pathway known for biphenyls and related compounds. Bezafibrate, naproxen and ibuprofen were degraded only cometabolically whereas no transformation was obtained for diclofenac. Some biodegradation intermediates in these batch tests could be tentatively identified by means of LC-MS. The first step in microbial bezafibrate degradation appears to be the hydrolytic cleavage of the amide bond, generating well degradable 4-chlorobenzoic acid as one of the hydrolysis products. As previously found for mammals, ether cleavage and formation of desmethylnaproxen was the initial step in microbial degradation of naproxen. Two isomers of hydroxy-ibuprofen were detected as intermediates in the mineralization of ibuprofen. Laboratory studies suggest that naproxen and ibuprofen can be fully mineralized whereas more stable metabolites occur in microbial ketoprofen and bezafibrate transformation, that may deserve further attention.

In this study, the use of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor to effectively degrade ketoprofen in a defined liquid medium was assessed. The fungus eliminated ketoprofen to nondetectable levels in 24h when it was added at 10mgL(-1) whereas at low concentration of 40microgL(-1) it was almost completely removed (95%) after 5h. Low extracellular laccase activity was detected in the T. versicolor cultures but the addition of the laccase-mediator system did not lead to ketoprofen oxidation. The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole reduced ketoprofen oxidation. These data suggest that the first oxidation step is cytochrome P450 mediated.

Induction tests with cells grown on limonene revealed that the oxygen consumption rates with limonene-1,2-epoxide, limonene-1,2-diol, 1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene, and carveol were high.

However, malathion has the potential to produce toxic effects in mammalian systems. In this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA 112 which was isolated from soil using enrichment technique could utilize the malathion as a sole carbon source and a source of energy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA112 was able to grow in MSMPY medium containing 42.75 mg/ml malathion. However, the optimum concentration of malathion which supported the maximum bacterial growth was found to be 22. 8 mg/ml. Malathion was used as an initial source of energy and carbon when it was found without additional carbon sources (in MSM medium) while it was utilized as second source of energy and carbon in a nutrient-supplemented medium (in MSMPY medium). Moreover, lead acetate test indicated that malathion was first attacked at a sulphur site 1-2 hours after the start of incubation. TLC and IR analysis indicated that malathion was completely degraded into diethyl succinate, hydrogen sulphide and phosphates. Therefore a malathion degradation pathway was proporsed. The degradation of malathion is attributed to the genes located on the chromosome and at least three proteins of high molecular size might be involved in malathion utilization.

(1994) Biochemistry 33, 635-643], Lys 166 and His 297 are positioned appropriately to participate in catalysis as acid/base catalysts, with Lys 166 participating as the (S)-specific acid/base catalyst and His 297 participating as the (R)-specific acid/base catalyst. The dependence of kcat on pH for the racemization of both (R)- and (S)-mandelates suggests that the pKaS of the conjugate acids of Lys 166 and His 297 are both approximately 6.4 [Landro, J.A., Kallarakal, A.T., Ransom, S.C., Gerlt, J.A., Kozarich, J.W., Neidhart, D.J., Kenyon, G.L. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9274-9281; Kallarakal, A.T., Mitra, B., Kozarich, J.W., Gerlt, J.A., Clifton, J.R., Petsko, G.A., & Kenyon, G.L. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2788-2797]. Both acid/base catalysts are in close proximity to and approximately equidistant to the epsilon-ammonium group of Lys 164 and the essential Mg2+. The positive electrostatic potential provided by these cationic groups might be expected to increase the acidities of the cationic conjugate acids of the acid/base catalysts, thereby explaining the depressed pKa of Lys 166 but not the ""normal"" pKa of His 297. Asp 270 is hydrogen bonded of N delta of His 297 and, therefore, may allow the pKa of His 297 to be normal. In this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which Asp 270 is replaced with asparagine (D270N). The structure of D270N with (S)-atrolactate bound in the active site reveals no geometric alterations in the active site when compared to the structure of wild-type MR complexed with (S)-atrolactate, with the exception that the side chain of His 297 is tilted and displaced approximately 0.5 A away from Asn 270 and toward the (S)-atrolactate. The kcatS for both (R)- and (S)-mandelates are reduced approximately 10(4)-fold. In accord with the proposal that Asp 270 influences the pKa of His 297, in the (R)- to (S)-direction no ascending limb is detected in the dependence of kcat of pH; instead, kcat decreases from a low pH plateau as described by a pKa of 10. In the (S)- to (R)-direction the dependence of kcat of pH is a bell-shaped curve that is described by pKaS of 6.4 and 10. In analogy to the previously reported properties of the H297N mutant [Landro, J.A., Kallarakal, A.T., Ransom, S.C., Gerlt, J.A., Kozarich, J.W., Neidhart, D.J., & Kenyon, G.L. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9274-9281], D270N catalyzes both the facile exchange of the alpha-proton of (S)- but not (R)-mandelate with solvent and the stereospecific elimination of bromide ion from (S)-p-(bromomethyl)mandalate. These observations suggest that His 297 and Asp 270 function as a catalytic dyad, with Asp 270 being at least partially responsible for the normal pKa of His 297 in wild-type MR.",10.1021/bi960174m,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8639525,https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/bi960174m,Mandelate,

The initial step in the biodegradative pathway of MSA in strain M2 involved an inducible NADH-specific monooxygenase enzyme (MSAMO). Partial purification of MSAMO from cell-free extracts by ion-exchange chromatography led to the loss of MSAMO activity. Activity was restored by the mixing of three distinct protein fractions designated A, B and C. The reconstituted enzyme had a narrow substrate specificity relative to crude cell-free extracts. Addition of FAD and ferrous ions to the reconstituted enzyme complex resulted in a fivefold increase in enzyme activity, suggesting the loss of FAD and ferrous ion from the multicomponent enzyme on purification.

The deduced polypeptide consists of 329 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 35,238. Although the purified enzyme was shown to contain tryptophan, no tryptophan codon was found in the tdc reading frame. Incubation of purified Tdc with [14C]tryptophan revealed apparent ""covalent"" binding of tryptophan, indicating posttranslational modification of the enzyme. A heptapeptide, 54Thr-55Gly-56Ser-57Phe-58Lys-59Ile- 60Arg, was found to contain Lys-58, which binds pyridoxal phosphate coenzyme. A comparison of amino acid sequences between the Tdc polypeptide and the biosynthetic threonine dehydratases of yeast (encoded by ILV1) and E. coli (encoded by ilvA) and the E. coli D-serine dehydratase (DsdA, encoded by dsdA) revealed various extents of homology: five domains of the Tdc polypeptide were 63-93% homologous with the yeast enzyme, and three of these same regions were 80% homologous with the biosynthetic E. coli dehydratase; two different domains showed 67% and 83% homology with DsdA. In addition, two other sequences were highly conserved in all four proteins, one of which was shown to contain the conserved lysine residue that binds pyridoxal phosphate in the Tdc and DsdA polypeptides.

Polypeptide fragmentation of this cross-reacting species was shown to be dependent on Pfl activase. Cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding this protein revealed that it coded for a new enzyme, termed TdcE, which has 82% identity with Pfl. On the basis of RNA analyses, the tdcE gene was shown to be part of a large operon that included the tdcABC genes, encoding an anaerobic threonine dehydratase, tdcD, coding for a propionate kinase, tdcF, the function of which is unknown, and the tdcG gene, which encodes a L-serine dehydratase. Expression of the tdcABCDEFG operon was strongly catabolite repressed. Enzyme studies showed that TdcE has both pyruvate formate-lyase and 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase activity, whereas the TdcD protein is a new propionate/acetate kinase. By monitoring culture supernatants from various mutants using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we followed the anaerobic conversion of L-threonine to propionate. These studies confirmed that 2-ketobutyrate, the product of threonine deamination, is converted in vivo by TdcE to propionyl-CoA. These studies also revealed that Pfl and an as yet unidentified thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme(s) can perform this reaction. Double null mutants deficient in phosphotransacetylase (Pta) and acetate kinase (AckA) or AckA and TdcD were unable to metabolize threonine to propionate, indicating that propionyl-CoA and propionyl-phosphate are intermediates in the pathway and that ATP is generated during the conversion of propionyl-P to propionate by AckA or TdcD.",10.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.00696.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9484901,https://sci-hub.se/10.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.00696.x,Methionine and Threonine,

Using one of the rare bacterial strains able to grow in the presence of MTBE, Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2012, the protein profiles of crude extracts after growth in the presence of MTBE and glucose were compared by SDS-PAGE. Ten proteins with molecular masses of 67, 64, 63, 55, 50, 27, 24, 17, 14 and 11 kDa were induced after growth in the presence of MTBE. Partial amino acid sequences of N-terminal and internal peptide fragments of the 64 kDa protein were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers to amplify total DNA by PCR, yielding a DNA fragment that was used as a probe for cloning. A two-step cloning procedure was performed to obtain a 10 327 bp genomic DNA fragment containing seven ORFs, including a putative regulator, mpdR, and four genes, mpdC, orf1, mpdB and orf2, in the same cluster. The MpdB protein (64 kDa) was related to a flavoprotein of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family, and the MpdC protein (55 kDa) showed a high similarity with NAD(P) aldehyde dehydrogenases. Heterologous expression of these gene products was performed in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155. The recombinant strain was able to degrade an intermediate of MTBE biodegradation, 2-methyl 1,2-propanediol, to hydroxyisobutyric acid.

Both a laboratory strain and natural isolates were able to degrade each compound after growth on propane. When propane-grown strain ENV425 was incubated with 20 mg of uniformly labeled [14C]MTBE per liter, the strain converted > 60% of the added MTBE to 14CO2 in < 30 h. The initial oxidation of MTBE and ETBE resulted in the production of nearly stoichiometric amounts of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), while the initial oxidation of TAME resulted in the production of tert-amyl alcohol. The methoxy methyl group of MTBE was oxidized to formaldehyde and ultimately to CO2. TBA was further oxidized to 2-methyl-2-hydroxy-1-propanol and then 2-hydroxy isobutyric acid; however, neither of these degradation products was an effective growth substrate for the propane oxidizers. Analysis of cell extracts of ENV425 and experiments with enzyme inhibitors implicated a soluble P-450 enzyme in the oxidation of both MTBE and TBA. MTBE was oxidized to TBA by camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida CAM, which produces the well-characterized P-450cam, but not by Rhodococcus rhodochrous 116, which produces two P-450 enzymes. Rates of MTBE degradation by propane-oxidizing strains ranged from 3.9 to 9.2 nmol/min/mg of cell protein at 28 degrees C, whereas TBA was oxidized at a rate of only 1.8 to 2.4 nmol/min/mg of cell protein at the same temperature.",10.1128/aem.63.11.4216-4222.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9361407,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.63.11.4216-4222.1997,Methyl tert-butyl ether,

Crotonate did not serve as an oxidant. A mutant of W. succinogenes lacking the fccABC operon was unable to catalyze methacrylate or acrylate reduction. In contrast, the inactivation of fccC alone had no effect on these activities. Methacrylate reduction by benzyl viologen radical was not catalyzed by fumarate reductase isolated from the membrane of W. succinogenes. Cells grown with formate and fumarate did not catalyze methacrylate reduction by formate, and W. succinogenes did not grow with formate and methacrylate as catabolic substrates. The results suggest that the reduction of methacrylate or acrylate by benzyl viologen radical is most likely catalyzed either by the periplasmic flavoprotein FccA or by a complex consisting of FccA and the predicted c-type cytochrome FccB.

They help to achieve better quality and quantity of crops; however, they also are capable of causing occupational diseases in farmers. Skin is the most exposed organ while spraying the pesticide on fields. Farmers are also exposed to pesticides while mixing, loading the pesticide as well as while cleaning the equipment and disposing of empty containers. Other activities associated with exposure are sowing pesticide-preserved seeds, weeding and harvesting previously sprayed crops. During the first decades of using pesticides the main problem was the risk of acute intoxication among people occupationally exposed. With decrease in the toxicity of improved pesticides, attention was turned to chronic intoxication and environmental contamination. Nowadays, the problem of diseases not immediately related to the toxic potential of pesticides gains increasing interest. The majority of these non-toxic diseases are dermatoses. Most pesticide-related dermatoses are contact dermatitis, both allergic or irritant. Rare clinical forms also occur, including urticaria, erythema multiforme, ashy dermatosis, parakeratosis variegata, porphyria cutanea tarda, chloracne, skin hypopigmentation, nail and hair disorders. Farmers exposed to arsenic pesticides are at risk of occupational skin cancer, mostly morbus Bowen (carcinoma in situ), multiple basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.

The reaction pathway is investigated for two electronic states, the doublet and the quartet, by means of density functional theory. The results show that morpholine hydroxylation occurs through hydrogen atom abstraction and rebound mechanism. However, in the low spin state, the reaction is concerted and hydrogen atom abstraction yields directly ferric-hydroxy morpholine complex without a distinct rebound step while in quartet state the reaction is stepwise. The presence of nitrogen in a morpholine heterocycle is postulated to greatly facilitate hydrogen abstraction. The hydroxylated product undergoes intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer from hydroxy group to nitrogen, leading to the cleavage of the C-N bond and the formation of 2-(2-aminoethoxy) acetaldehyde. The cleavage of the C-N bond is indicated as the rate-determining step for the studied reaction.

As treated water is increasingly used for landscape irrigation, there is an imperative need to understand the leaching risk for NDMA in landscape soils. In this study, adsorption and incubation experiments were conducted using landscape soils planted with turfgrass, ground cover, and trees. Adsorption of NDMA was negligibly weak (K(d) < 1) in all soils, indicating that NDMA has a high potential for moving with percolating water in these soils. Degradation of NDMA occurred at different rates among these soils. At 21 degrees C, the half-life (t(1/2)) of NDMA was 4.1 d for the ground cover soil, 5.6 d for the turfgrass soil, and 22.5 d for the tree soil. The persistence was substantially prolonged after autoclaving or when incubated at 10 degrees C. The rate of degradation was not significantly affected by the initial NDMA concentration or addition of organic and inorganic nutrient sources. The relative persistence was inversely correlated with soil organic matter content, soil microbial biomass, and soil dehydrogenase activity, suggesting the importance of microorganisms in NDMA degradation in these soils. These results suggest that the behavior of NDMA depends closely on the vegetation cover in a landscape system, and prolonged persistence and increased leaching may be expected in soils with sparse vegetation due to low organic matter content and limited microbial activity.",10.2134/jeq2005.0336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15647563,https://sci-hub.se/10.2134/jeq2005.0336,N-Nitrosodimethylamine,

This study shows that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes functionally similar to those demonstrated to degrade NDMA in eukaryotes have the capability to degrade NDMA. Specifically, induction of the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) expressed by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, the propane monooxygenase (PMO) enzyme of Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5, and the toluene 4-monooxygenases found in Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 resulted in NDMA degradation by these strains. In each of these cases, brief exposure to acetylene gas, a suicide substrate for certain monooxygenases, inhibited the degradation of NDMA. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene monooxygenases found in strains PKO1 and KR1 mimicked the behavior of the parent strains. In contrast, M. trichosporium OB3b expressing the particulate form of MMO, Burkholderia cepacia G4 expressing the toluene 2-monooxygenase, and Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing the toluene sidechain monooxygenase were not capable of NDMA degradation.

Log-log plots of the data were fitted with both linear and nonlinear least-squares analyses; however, linear models provided better fits for the kinetic data in all cases. The slopes of the linear fits were not significantly different than 1.0 (P < 0.05); thus, first-order reaction kinetics were in effect over the range of concentrations tested, and saturation kinetics were not achieved. Rate constants (day) and total percent mineralized increased with decreasing initial concentrations of NDMA. Rates of mineralization were reduced in aqueous systems when supplemental carbon was available, whereas in soils, percentages of organic matter and supplemental carbon had little effect on rates of mineralization. Implications of these results for predictions of rates and threshold limits of mineralization activity in natural systems are discussed. A laboratory scale simulated trickling filter containing an activated charcoal bed provided a suitable environment for mineralization of NDMA at concentrations of 50 and 100 mug/ml on a continuous basis.

Partial sequences of a tauY-like gene (encoding the putative large component of taurine dehydrogenase) and an xsc gene were obtained by PCR with degenerate primers. Strain N-MT utilized N-methyltaurine as a sole source of fixed nitrogen for growth and could also utilize the compound as sole source of carbon. This bacterium was identified as a strain of Paracoccus versutus. This organism also expressed inducible (N-methyl)taurine dehydrogenase, Xsc and a sulfite dehydrogenase. The presence of a gene cluster with high identity to a larger cluster from Paracoccus pantotrophus NKNCYSA, which is now known to dissimilate N-methyltaurine via Xsc, allowed most of the overall pathway, including transport and excretion, to be defined. N-Methyltaurine is thus another compound whose catabolism is channelled directly through sulfoacetaldehyde.",10.1099/mic.0.28622-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16549680,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/mic.0.28622-0,N-Oleoyl-N-methyltaurine,

FlhRS-deficient mutants were unable to grow on methanol, methylamine, or choline as the carbon and energy source. Expression of the gene encoding glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (fhlA) was undetectable in the mutant, and expression of the S-formylglutathione hydrolase gene (fghA) was reduced in the mutant background. In addition, methanol dehydrogenase was immunologically undetectable in cell extracts of FhlRS mutants. These results indicate that the FlhRS sensor-regulator pair is involved in the regulation of formaldehyde, methanol, and methylamine oxidation.

When intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carrying DNA fragments encoding the first three enzymes of the pathway were incubated with naphthalene, they formed products of the dioxygenase-catalyzed ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. These products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (tHBPA). HCCA was detected as the first reaction product in these incubation mixtures by its characteristic UV spectrum, which slowly changed to a spectrum indicative of an equilibrium mixture of HCCA and tHBPA. Isomerization of either purified product occurred slowly and spontaneously to give an equilibrium mixture of essentially the same composition. tHBPA is also formed from HCCA by the action of an isomerase enzyme encoded by plasmid NAH7. The gene encoding this enzyme, nahD, was cloned on a 1.95-kb KpnI-BglII fragment. Extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying this fragment catalyzed the rapid equilibration of HCCA and tHBPA. Metabolism of tHBPA to salicylaldehyde by hydration and aldol cleavage is catalyzed by a single enzyme encoded by a 1-kb MluI-StuI restriction fragment. A mechanism for the hydratase-aldolase-catalyzed reaction is proposed. The salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, nahF, was cloned on a 2.75-kb BamHI fragment which also carries the naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene, nahB. On the basis of the identification of the enzymes encoded by various clones, the gene order for the nah operon was shown to be p, A, B, F, C, E, D.",10.1128/jb.174.23.7542-7554.1992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1447127,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.174.23.7542-7554.1992,Naphthalene,

The incorporation of naphthalene-derived carbon into the bulk biomass as well as into specified biomass fractions such as fatty acids and amino acids was confirmed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and isotope analyses. Metabolites were characterized by GC-MS; the established structures allow tracing the degradation pathway under thermophilic conditions. Apart from typical metabolites of naphthalene degradation known from mesophiles, intermediates such as 2, 3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 2-carboxycinnamic acid, and phthalic and benzoic acid were identified for the pathway of this bacterium.

Catabolic activities for naphthalene, 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, and 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid are induced by growth with naphthalene, 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, methylnaphthalene, or salicylate. Gentisate is also an inducer in strain A3. Inhibition kinetics show that naphthalene and substituted naphthalenes are hydroxylated by the same naphthalene dioxygenase. Substrates with nondissociable substituents such as CH(3), OCH(3), Cl, or NO(2) are hydroxylated in the 7,8-position, and 4-substituted salicylates are accumulated. If CO(2)H, CH(2)CO(2)H, or SO(3)H are substituents, hydroxylation occurs with high regioselectivity in the 1,2-position. Thus, 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids are formed quantitatively from the corresponding naphthalenecarboxylic acids.

As one of the 'fixed' forms of nitrogen, nitrate plays an essential role in both nature and industry. For bacteria, it is both a nitrogen source and an electron acceptor. In agriculture and wastewater treatment, nitrate respiration by microorganisms is an important issue with respect to economics, greenhouse gas emission and public health. Several microbial processes compete for nitrate: denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and anaerobic ammonium oxidation. In this review we provide an up to date overview of the organisms, genes and enzymes involved in nitrate respiration. We also address the molecular detection of these processes in nature. We show that despite rapid progress in the experimental and genomic analyses of pure cultures, knowledge on the mechanism of nitrate reduction in natural ecosystems is still largely lacking.",10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.12.025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21219945,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.12.025,Nitrate (anaerobic),
9409151,Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.,Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,Zumft WG,"Denitrification is a distinct means of energy conservation, making use of N oxides as terminal electron acceptors for cellular bioenergetics under anaerobic, microaerophilic, and occasionally aerobic conditions. The process is an essential branch of the global N cycle, reversing dinitrogen fixation, and is associated with chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, diazotrophic, or organotrophic metabolism but generally not with obligately anaerobic life. Discovered more than a century ago and believed to be exclusively a bacterial trait, denitrification has now been found in halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea and in the mitochondria of fungi, raising evolutionarily intriguing vistas. Important advances in the biochemical characterization of denitrification and the underlying genetics have been achieved with Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paracoccus denitrificans, Ralstonia eutropha, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Pseudomonads represent one of the largest assemblies of the denitrifying bacteria within a single genus, favoring their use as model organisms. Around 50 genes are required within a single bacterium to encode the core structures of the denitrification apparatus. Much of the denitrification process of gram-negative bacteria has been found confined to the periplasm, whereas the topology and enzymology of the gram-positive bacteria are less well established. The activation and enzymatic transformation of N oxides is based on the redox chemistry of Fe, Cu, and Mo. Biochemical breakthroughs have included the X-ray structures of the two types of respiratory nitrite reductases and the isolation of the novel enzymes nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, as well as their structural characterization by indirect spectroscopic means. This revealed unexpected relationships among denitrification enzymes and respiratory oxygen reductases. Denitrification is intimately related to fundamental cellular processes that include primary and secondary transport, protein translocation, cytochrome c biogenesis, anaerobic gene regulation, metalloprotein assembly, and the biosynthesis of the cofactors molybdopterin and heme D1. An important class of regulators for the anaerobic expression of the denitrification apparatus are transcription factors of the greater FNR family. Nitrate and nitric oxide, in addition to being respiratory substrates, have been identified as signaling molecules for the induction of distinct N oxide-metabolizing enzymes.",10.1128/mmbr.61.4.533-616.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9409151,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/mmbr.61.4.533-616.1997,Nitrate (anaerobic),

In Chelatobacter heintzii ATCC 29600, biodegradation of NTA is initiated by NTA monooxygenase that oxidizes NTA to iminodiacetate and glyoxylate. The NTA monooxygenase activity requires two component proteins, component A and component B, but the function of each component is unclear. We have cloned and sequenced a gene cluster encoding components A and B (nmoA and nmoB) and two additional open reading frames, nmoR and nmoT, downstream of nmoA. Based on sequence similarities, nmoR and nmoT probably encode a regulatory protein and a transposase, respectively. The NmoA sequence was similar to a monooxygenase that uses reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) as reductant; NmoB was similar to an NADH:flavin mononucleotide (FMN) oxidoreductase. On the basis of this information, we tested the function of each component. Purified component B was shown to be an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase, and its activity could be separated from that of component A. When the Photobacterium fischeri NADH:FMN oxidoreductase was substituted for component B in the complete reaction, NTA was oxidized, showing that the substrate specificity of the reaction resides in component A. Component A is therefore an NTA monooxygenase that uses FMNH2 and O2 to oxidize NTA, and component B is an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase that provides FMNH2 for NTA oxidation.",10.1128/jb.179.4.1112-1116.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9023192,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.179.4.1112-1116.1997,Nitrilotriacetate (an/aerobic),

In membrane-free cell extracts, the first step of NTA oxidation was catalyzed by a protein complex consisting of two enzymes, NTA dehydrogenase (NTADH) and nitrate reductase (NtR). The products formed were iminodiacetate and glyoxylate. Electrons derived from the oxidation of NTA were transferred to nitrate only via the artificial dye phenazine methosulfate, and nitrate was stoichiometrically reduced to nitrite. NTADH activity could be measured only in the presence of NtrR and vice versa. The NTADH-NtrR enzyme complex was purified and characterized. NTADH and NtrR were both alpha 2 dimers and had molecular weights of 170,000 and 105,000, respectively. NTADH contained covalently bound flavin cofactor, and NtrR contained a type b cytochrome. Optimum NTA-oxidizing activity was achieved at a molar ratio of NTADH to NtrR of approximately 1:1. So far, NTA is the only known substrate for NTADH.

The range of aromatic substrates able to support growth was limited to nitrobenzene, hydroxylaminobenzene, and 2-aminophenol. Washed suspensions of nitrobenzene-grown cells removed nitrobenzene from culture fluids with the concomitant release of ammonia. Nitrobenzene, nitrosobenzene, hydroxylaminobenzene, and 2-aminophenol stimulated oxygen uptake in resting cells and in extracts of nitrobenzene-grown cells. Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, crude extracts converted nitrobenzene to 2-aminophenol with oxidation of 2 mol of NADPH. Ring cleavage, which required ferrous iron, produced a transient yellow product with a maximum A380. In the presence of NAD, the product disappeared and NADH was produced. In the absence of NAD, the ring fission product was spontaneously converted to picolinic acid, which was not further metabolized. These results indicate that the catabolic pathway involves the reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene and then to hydroxylaminobenzene; each of these steps requires 1 mol of NADPH. An enzyme-mediated Bamberger-like rearrangement converts hydroxylaminobenzene to 2-aminophenol, which then undergoes meta ring cleavage to 2-aminomuconic semialdehyde.

A total of 95 open reading frames appear to be involved in (i) the replication, maintenance, and transfer of pCNB1; (ii) resistance to arsenate and chromate; and (iii) the degradation of 4CNB. The 4CNB degradative genes and arsenate resistance genes were located on an extraordinarily large transposon (44.5 kb), proposed as TnCNB1. TnCNB1 was flanked by two IS1071 elements and represents a new member of the composite I transposon family. The 4CNB degradative genes within TnCNB1 were separated by various truncated genes and genetic homologs from other DNA molecules. Genes for chromate resistance were located on another transposon that was similar to the Tn21 transposon of the class II replicative family that is frequently responsible for the mobilization of mercury resistance genes. Resistance to arsenate and chromate were experimentally confirmed, and transcriptions of arsenate and chromate resistance genes were demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR.

Some metabolites and parent compounds are considered as possible mutagens and endocrine disruptors. Both properties pose serious hygienic and environmental risks. Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 is a well-known degrader of polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and diphenyl ethers. However, no detailed research of its metabolic activity has been performed against pesticides with a diphenyl ether scaffold. In this study, we report S. wittichii RW1 as a very potent diphenyl ether herbicide-metabolizing bacterium with broad substrate specificity. The structures of metabolites were determined by instrumental analysis and synthetic standards. Most pesticides were rapidly removed from the culture medium in the order of nitrofen > oxyfluorfen > chlomethoxyfen. In general, herbicides were degraded through the initial reduction and N-acetylation of nitro groups, followed by ether bond cleavage. Relatively low concentrations of phenolic and catecholic metabolites throughout the study suggested that these metabolites were rapidly metabolized and incorporated into primary metabolism.

The pathway of CNP degradation was elucidated by the identification of fungal metabolites upon addition of CNP and its metabolic intermediates. The metabolic pathway was initially branched to form four metabolites--2, 4, 6-trichloro-3-hydroxy-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether, 2, 4-dichloro-6-hydroxy-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether, NIP, and 2, 4, 6-trichloro-4'-aminodiphenyl ether--indicating the involvement of hydroxylation, oxidative dechlorination, reductive dechlorination, and nitro-reduction. Of these reactions, hydroxylation was relatively major compared to the others. Extracellular ligninolytic enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase did not catalyze the oxidation of either CNP or NIP. Piperonyl butoxide, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, suppressed fungal oxidation of CNP and NIP to their hydroxylated products. The inhibition resulted in increasing the amount of reductively dechlorinated and nitro-reduced products.

While 9 of 13 laboratory bacterial strains that presumably had no previous exposure to NG could degrade low concentrations of NG (0.44 mM), the natural isolates tolerated concentrations of NG that were toxic to the lab strains (1.76 mM and higher). Whole-cell studies revealed that the two natural isolates produced different mixtures of the isomers of dinitroglycerol (DNG) and mononitroglycerol (MNG). A monomeric, flavin mononucleotide-containing NG reductase was purified from each natural isolate. These enzymes catalyzed the NADPH-dependent denitration of NG, yielding nitrite. Apparent kinetic constants were determined for both reductases. The P. putida enzyme had a Km for NG of 52 +/- 4 microM, a Km for NADPH of 28 +/- 2 microM, and a Vmax of 124 +/- 6 microM x min(-1), while the P. fluorescens enzyme had a Km for NG of 110 +/- 10 microM, a Km for NADPH of 5 +/- 1 microM, and a Vmax of 110 +/- 11 microM x min(-1). Anaerobic titration experiments confirmed the stoichiometry of NADPH consumption, changes in flavin oxidation state, and multiple steps of nitrite removal from NG. The products formed during time-dependent denitration reactions were consistent with a single enzyme being responsible for the in vivo product distributions. Simulation of the product formation kinetics by numerical integration showed that the P. putida enzyme produced an approximately 2-fold molar excess of 1,2-DNG relative to 1,3-DNG. This result could be fortuitous or could possibly be consistent with a random removal of the first nitro group from either the terminal (C-1 and C-3) positions or middle (C-2) position. However, during the denitration of 1,2-DNG, a 1.3-fold selectivity for the C-1 nitro group was determined. Comparable simulations of the product distributions from the P. fluorescens enzyme showed that NG was denitrated with a 4.6-fold selectivity for the C-2 position. Furthermore, a 2.4-fold selectivity for removal of the nitro group from the C-2 position of 1,2-DNG was also determined. The MNG isomers were not effectively denitrated by either purified enzyme, which suggests a reason why NG could not be used as a sole carbon source by the isolated organisms.",10.1128/jb.179.22.6912-6920.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9371434,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.179.22.6912-6920.1997,Nitroglycerin,

The degradative pathways of PNP and NC were elucidated on the basis of enzyme assays and chemical characterization of the intermediates by TLC, GC, (1)H NMR, GC-MS, UV spectroscopy, and HPLC analyses. Our studies clearly indicate that the degradation of PNP proceeds with the formation of p-benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (HQ) and is further degraded via the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Degradation of NC involved initial oxidation to generate 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone; the latter intermediate is then reductively dehydroxylated, forming BQ and HQ, and is further cleaved via beta-ketoadipate to TCA intermediates. It is likely, therefore, that the same set of genes encode the further metabolism of HQ in PNP and NC degradation. A plasmid of approximately 65 kb was found to be responsible for harboring genes for PNP and NC degradation in this strain.

ONP derivatives which were para-substituted with a methyl-, chloro-, carboxy-, formyl- or nitro-group failed to support growth of strain B2.

A 10,152-bp DNA fragment extending from a conserved region of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene was obtained by genome walking. Of seven complete open reading frames deduced from this fragment, three (onpABC) have been shown to encode the enzymes involved in the initial reactions of ONP catabolism in this strain. OnpA, which shares 26% identity with salicylate 1-monooxygenase of Pseudomonas stutzeri AN10, is an ONP 2-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.31) which converts ONP to catechol in the presence of NADPH, with concomitant nitrite release. OnpC is a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase catalyzing the oxidation of catechol to cis,cis-muconic acid. OnpB exhibits 54% identity with the reductase subunit of vanillate O-demethylase in Pseudomonas fluorescens BF13. OnpAB (but not OnpA alone) conferred on the catechol utilizer Pseudomonas putida PaW340 the ability to grow on ONP. This suggests that OnpB may also be involved in ONP degradation in vivo as an o-benzoquinone reductase converting o-benzoquinone to catechol.

To show that the reaction was really catalyzed by a single enzyme without the release of intermediates, the corresponding protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from an extract of cells grown on 3-nitrophenol as the nitrogen source and succinate as the carbon and energy source. 3-Hydroxylaminophenol mutase appears to be a relatively hydrophobic but soluble and colorless protein consisting of a single 62-kDa polypeptide. The pI was determined to be at pH 4.5. In a database search, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the undigested protein and of two internal sequences of 3-hydroxylaminophenol mutase were found to be most similar to those of glutamine synthetases from different species. Hydroxylaminobenzene, 4-hydroxylaminotoluene, and 2-chloro-5-hydroxylaminophenol, but not 4-hydroxylaminobenzoate, can also serve as substrates for the enzyme. The enzyme requires no oxygen or added cofactors for its reaction, which suggests an enzymatic mechanism analogous to the acid-catalyzed Bamberger rearrangement.",10.1128/JB.181.5.1444-1450.1999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10049374,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.181.5.1444-1450.1999,Nitrophenol Family (an/aerobic),

Ammonia, 2-aminophenol, 4-aminophenol, 4-benzoquinone, N-acetyl-4-aminophenol, N-acetyl-2-aminophenol, 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one, 4-hydroquinone, and catechol were produced from hydroxylaminobenzene. Ammonia, N-acetyl-2-aminophenol, and 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one were produced from 2-aminophenol. All of these metabolites were also found in the nitrobenzene transformation medium, and this demonstrated that they were metabolites of nitrobenzene transformation via hydroxylaminobenzene. Production of 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one indicated that oxidation of 2-aminophenol via imine occurred. Rapid release of ammonia from 2-aminophenol transformation indicated that hydrolysis of the imine intermediate was the dominant reaction. The low level of 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one indicated that formation of this compound was probably due to a spontaneous reaction accompanying oxidation of 2-aminophenol via imine. 4-Hydroquinone and catechol were reduction products of 2- and 4-benzoquinones. Based on these transformation products, we propose a new ammonia release pathway via oxidation of aminophenol to benzoquinone monoimine and subsequent hydrolysis for transformation of nitroaromatic compounds by 3-nitrophenol-grown cells of P. putida 2NP8.

As the serpentine and amphibole forms of asbestos were phased out, synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs; fiber glass, mineral wool, and refractory fiber) became increasingly utilized, and concerns were raised that they too might cause adverse health effects. Extensive toxicological research on SVFs has demonstrated that their pulmonary effects are directly related to fiber dose in the lung over time. This is the result of deposition (thin fibers deposit in the lower lung more efficiently than thick fibers) and lung-persistence (""biopersistence"" is directly related to fiber length and inversely related to dissolution and fragmentation rates). In rat inhalation studies, asbestos was determined to be 7- to 10-fold more biopersistent in the lung than SVFs. Other than its effect on biopersistence, fiber composition did not appear to play a direct role in the biological activity of SVFs. Recently, the utilization of man-made organic fibers (MMOFs) (also referred to by some as synthetic organic fibers) has increased rapidly for a variety of applications. In contrast to SVFs, research on the potential pulmonary effects of MMOFs is relatively limited, because traditionally MMOFs were manufactured in diameters too thick to be respirable (inhalable into the lower lung). However, new developments in the MMOF industry have resulted in the production of increasingly fine-diameter fibers for special applications, and certain post-manufacturing processes (e.g., chopping) generate respirable-sized MMOF dust. Until the mid-1990s, there was no consistent evidence of human health affects attributed to occupational exposure to MMOFs. Very recently, however, a unique form of interstitial lung disease has been reported in nylon flock workers in three different plants, and respirable-sized nylon shreds (including fibers) were identified in workplace air samples. Whether nylon dust or other occupational exposures are responsible for the development of lung disease in these workers remains to be determined. It is also unknown whether the biological mechanisms that determine the respirability and toxicity of SVFs apply to MMOFs. Thus, it is appropriate and timely to review the current data regarding MMOF workplace exposure and pulmonary health effects, including the database on epidemiological, exposure assessment, and toxicology studies.",10.1080/20014091111965,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11763480,https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/20014091111965,Nylon Oligomer,

Experiments with cell suspensions and cell extracts indicate that orcinol is metabolized by hydroxylation of the benzene ring followed successively by ring cleavage and hydrolyses to give 2 mol of acetate and 1 mol of pyruvate per mol of orcinol as shown: orcinol leads to 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene leads to 2,4,6-trioxoheptanoate leads to acetate + acetylpyruvate leads to acetate + pyruvate. Evidence for this pathway is based on: (i) high respiratory activities of orcinol-grown cells towards 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene; (ii) transient accumulation of a quinone, probably 2-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, during grouth with orcinol; (iii) formation of pyruvate and acetate from orcinol, 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene, and acetylpyruvate catalyzed by extracts of orcinol, but not by succinate-grown cells; (iv) characterization of the product of oxidation of 3-methylcatechol (an analogue of 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene) showing that oxygenative cleavage occurs between carbons bearing methyl and hydroxyl substituents; (v) transient appearance of a compound having spectral properties similar to those of acetylpyruvate during 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene oxidation by extracts of orcinol-grown cells. Orcinol hydroxylase exhibits catalytic activity when resorcinol or m-cresol is substituted for orcinol; hydroxyquinol and 3-methylcatechol are substrates for the ring cleavage enzyme 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene-1,2-oxygenase.

Microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (MerA). The latter, a homodimer with homology to the FAD-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction NADPH + Hg(II)----NADP+ + H+ + Hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates. Human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for FAD-dependent disulphide reductases and between its primary structure and that of MerA from Tn501 (Pseudomonas), Tn21 (Shigella), p1258 (Staphylococcus) and Bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved. All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini. Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp. strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. We report here the crystal structure of MerA from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp. strain RC607.

Although the fact that microbes reduce these compounds has been recognized for more than 50 years, only six organisms which can obtain energy for growth by this metabolic process have been described. As part of a study to investigate the diversity and ubiquity of microorganisms involved in the microbial reduction of (per)chlorate, we enumerated the (per)chlorate-reducing bacteria (ClRB) in very diverse environments, including pristine and hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, aquatic sediments, paper mill waste sludges, and farm animal waste lagoons. In all of the environments tested, the acetate-oxidizing ClRB represented a significant population, whose size ranged from 2.31 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(6) cells per g of sample. In addition, we isolated 13 ClRB from these environments. All of these organisms could grow anaerobically by coupling complete oxidation of acetate to reduction of (per)chlorate. Chloride was the sole end product of this reductive metabolism. All of the isolates could also use oxygen as a sole electron acceptor, and most, but not all, could use nitrate. The alternative electron donors included simple volatile fatty acids, such as propionate, butyrate, or valerate, as well as simple organic acids, such as lactate or pyruvate. Oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra of washed whole-cell suspensions of the isolates had absorbance maxima close to 425, 525, and 550 nm, which are characteristic of type c cytochromes. In addition, washed cell suspensions of all of the ClRB isolates could dismutate chlorite, an intermediate in the reductive metabolism of (per)chlorate, into chloride and molecular oxygen. Chlorite dismutation was a result of the activity of a single enzyme which in pure form had a specific activity of approximately 1,928 micromol of chlorite per mg of protein per min. Analyses of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of the organisms indicated that they all belonged to the alpha, beta, or gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria. Several were closely related to members of previously described genera that are not recognized for the ability to reduce (per)chlorate, such as the genera Pseudomonas and Azospirllum. However, many were not closely related to any previously described organism and represented new genera within the Proteobacteria.

The basic structure of pyrethroids can be characterized as an acid joined to an alcohol by an ester bond. Pyrethroid degradation occurs through either oxidation at one or more sites located in the alcohol or acid moieties or hydrolysis at the central ester bond, the latter reaction being important for mammalian metabolism of most pyrethroids. The primary alcohol liberated from the ester cleavage is hydroxylated to 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, which for most pyrethroids is then oxidized to 3-phenoxybenzoic acid. These products may then be conjugated with amino acids, sulfates, sugars, or sugar acids. In vitro studies have suggested that some of the pyrethroids may have estrogenic activity. Interestingly, the chemical structure of specific pyrethroid metabolites indicates that they may be more likely to interact with the estrogen receptor than the parent compounds. Two of the pyrethroid metabolites, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA) and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (3PBalc) have been reported to have endocrine activity using a yeast based assay. 3PBAlc exhibited estrogenic activity with reported EC(50)s of 6.67 x 10(-6) and 2 x 10(-5) while 3PBAcid exhibited anti-estrogenic activity with a calculated IC(50) of 6.5 x 10(-5). To determine if the metabolites were able to cause the same effects in a mammalian system, the estrogen-dependent cell line, MCF-7, was utilized. Cells were treated with 1.0, 10.0 or 100.0 microM concentrations of each metabolite and cytotoxicity was assessed. The two lowest concentrations of both metabolites did not induce cell death and even appeared to increase proliferation over that of the control cells. However, when cellular proliferation was measured using a Coulter counter neither metabolite stimulated proliferation (1.0 nM, 10.0 nM, or 10.0 microM) or induced an estrogen receptor alpha/ERE-controlled luciferase reporter in the MCF-7 cells. Following the in vitro screenings, the metabolites were then evaluated for estrogenic activity in vivo using the uterotrophic assay in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were orally gavaged (10.0, 5.0, and 1.0 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days. Neither metabolite had any effect on uterine wet weight, body weight, or organ weight.

This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression. Community cooperation probably enhances the effectiveness of processes such as bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development. Unlike other autoinducers, which are specific to a particular species of bacteria, a recently discovered autoinducer (AI-2) is produced by a large number of bacterial species. AI-2 has been proposed to serve as a 'universal' signal for inter-species communication. The chemical identity of AI-2 has, however, proved elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of an AI-2 sensor protein, LuxP, in a complex with autoinducer. The bound ligand is a furanosyl borate diester that bears no resemblance to previously characterized autoinducers.

Surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem. Although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown. Here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16% of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. This strategy is exceptional in several aspects. Intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA becomes activated to a ring 1,2-epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase. The reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member O-heterocyclic enol ether, an oxepin. This isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and beta-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. This widespread paradigm differs significantly from the established chemistry of aerobic aromatic catabolism, thus widening our view of how organisms exploit such inert substrates. It provides insight into the natural remediation of man-made environmental contaminants such as styrene.

Because these products lack a carboxyl group at the 2 position, they were not substrates for the next enzyme of the phthalate catabolic pathway, 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate 2-decarboxylase, and accumulated. When these incubations were carried out in iron-containing minimal medium, the products formed colored chelates. This chromogenic response was subsequently used to identify recombinant Escherichia coli strains carrying genes encoding the responsible enzymes, phthalate 3,4-dioxygenase and 3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrophthalate dehydrogenase, from the 130-kbp plasmid pRE1 of strain 12B. Beginning with the initially cloned 8.14-kbp PstI fragment of pRE824 as a probe to identify recombinant plasmids carrying overlapping fragments, a DNA segment of 33.5 kbp was cloned from pRE1 on several plasmids and mapped using restriction endonucleases. From these plasmids, the sequence of 26,274 contiguous bp was determined. Sequenced DNA included several genetic units: tnpR, pcm operon, ptr genes, pehA, norA fragment, and pht operon, encoding a transposon resolvase, catabolism of protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter, a possible phthalate ester hydrolase, a fragment of a norfloxacin resistance-like transporter, and the conversion of phthalate to protocatechuate, respectively.

While the biodegradation of the parent compound, phthalate (PTH), is well characterized, the biodegradation of PEs is not well understood. In particular, prior to this study, genes involved in the uptake and hydrolysis of these compounds were not conclusively identified. We found that Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 could grow on a variety of monoalkyl PEs, including methyl, butyl, hexyl, and 2-ethylhexyl PTHs. Strain RHA1 could not grow on most dialkyl PEs, but suspensions of cells grown on PTH transformed dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dihexyl and di-(2-ethylhexyl) PTHs. The major products of these dialkyl PEs were PTH and the corresponding monoalkyl PEs, and minor products resulted from the shortening of the alkyl side chains. RHA1 exhibited an inducible, ATP-dependent uptake system for PTH with a K(m) of 22 microM. The deletion and complementation of the patB gene demonstrated that the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter encoded by patDABC is required for the uptake of PTH and monoalkyl PEs by RHA1. The hydrolase encoded by patE of RHA1 was expressed in Escherichia coli. PatE specifically hydrolyzed monoalkyl PEs to PTH but did not transform dialkyl PEs or other aromatic esters.

The genes were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tag fusion proteins that were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The enzyme activity of each protein was determined by spectrophotometry and HPLC analyses.

Similarly, NpdI also transformed 2,4-DNP to the hydride sigma-complex of 2,4-DNP. A second hydride transferase, NpdC catalysed a subsequent hydride transfer to H(-)-PA, to produce a dihydride sigma-complex of picric acid (2H(-)-PA). All three reactions required the activity of NpdG, an NADPH-dependent F420 reductase, for shuttling the hydride ions from NADPH to F420. NpdH converted 2H(-)-PA to a hitherto unknown product, X.

In the absence of CO2, whole-cell suspensions of propylene-grown cells catalyzed the isomerization of propylene oxide (epoxypropane) to acetone. In the presence of CO2, no acetone was produced. Acetone was not metabolized by suspensions of propylene-grown cells, in either the absence or presence of CO2. The degradation of propylene and propylene oxide by propylene-grown cells supported the fixation of 14CO2 into cell material, and the time course of 14C fixation correlated with the time course of propylene and propylene oxide degradation. The degradation of glucose and propionaldehyde by propylene-grown or glucose-grown cells did not support significant 14CO2 fixation. With propylene oxide as the substrate, the concentration dependence of 14CO2 fixation exhibited saturation kinetics, and at saturation, 0.9 mol of CO2 was fixed per mol of propylene oxide consumed.

The bacteria could use pyrene as their sole carbon and energy source in a basal salts medium (BSM) and mineralized significant amounts of benzo[a]pyrene cometabolically when pyrene was also present in BSM. P. janthinellum VUO 10,201 could not utilize any high-molecular-weight PAH as sole carbon and energy source but could partially degrade these if cultured in a nutrient broth. Although small amounts of chrysene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene were degraded by axenic cultures of these isolates in BSM containing a single PAH, such conditions did not support significant microbial growth or PAH mineralization. However, significant degradation of, and microbial growth on, pyrene, chrysene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene, each as a single PAH in BSM, occurred when P. janthinellum VUO 10,201 and either bacterial consortium VUN 10,009 or S. maltophilia VUN 10,010 were combined in the one culture, i.e., fungal-bacterial cocultures: 25% of the benzo[a]pyrene was mineralized to CO(2) by these cocultures over 49 days, accompanied by transient accumulation and disappearance of intermediates detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Inoculation of fungal-bacterial cocultures into PAH-contaminated soil resulted in significantly improved degradation of high-molecular-weight PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene mineralization (53% of added [(14)C]benzo[a]pyrene was recovered as (14)CO(2) in 100 days), and reduction in the mutagenicity of organic soil extracts, compared with the indigenous microbes and soil amended with only axenic inocula.",10.1128/AEM.66.3.1007-1019.2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10698765,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.66.3.1007-1019.2000,Pyrene,

Further degradation studies with PYR showed three metabolites formed by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135, including 4,5-phenanthrene-dicarboxylic acid not previously isolated, 4-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid, and 4,5-pyrene-dihydrodiol. At least two dihydrodiols, 5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol and 10,11-BAA-dihydrodiol, were confirmed by high-resolution mass spectral and fluorescence analyses as products of the biodegradation of BAA by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135. Additionally, a cleavage product of BAA was also isolated. Mass spectra and fluorescence data support two different routes for the degradation of BaP by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135. The 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol and three cleavage products of BaP, including 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid and a dihydro-pyrene-carboxylic acid metabolite, have been isolated and identified as degradation products formed by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135. These latter results represent the first example of the isolation of BaP ring fission products formed by a bacterial isolate. We propose that while this bacterium appears to attack only one site of the PYR molecule, it is capable of degrading different sites of the BAA and BaP molecules, and although the sites of attack may be different, the ability of this bacterium to degrade these PAH is well supported. The proposed pathways for biodegradation of these compounds by this Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 support the dioxygenase enzymatic processes reported previously for other bacteria.

The ORFs were assigned to the following functional groups: (i) catabolism of quinaldine and anthranilate, (ii) conjugation, and (iii) plasmid maintenance and DNA replication and repair. The genes for conversion of quinaldine to anthranilate are organized in two operons that include ORFs presumed to code for proteins involved in assembly of the quinaldine-4-oxidase holoenzyme, namely, a MobA-like putative molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide synthase and an XdhC-like protein that could be required for insertion of the molybdenum cofactor.

Recently, we found a new glycogenolytic pathway in rat liver in which glycogen is first metabolized to 1, 5-anhydrofructose (AnFru) and then to 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AnGlc-ol). Because the amounts of glycogen and AnFru are closely related in various rat organs and the second reaction, AnFru to AnGlc-ol, is strongly inhibited in the presence of glucose, we expected that this pathway might play a regulatory role in glycogen metabolism. Here we evaluate the expected involvement of AnGlc-ol and AnFru in the regulatory mechanism in Escherichia coli C600. Having established the presence of this new glycogenolytic pathway in E. coli C600, we further show that the conversion of AnFru to AnGlc-ol is activated only after the exhaustion of glucose in the medium, and that as little as 5 microM AnGlc-ol in the medium acutely accelerates the degradation of glycogen by 40%. We consider the role of AnGlc-ol in the mechanism that controls glycogen metabolism in E. coli to be as follows. When glucose is abundant, E. coli accumulate glycogen, a fraction of which is steadily degraded so that the amount of AnFru is about 1/1,000 of glycogen on a weight basis. When glucose is depleted and the demand for glycogen utilization is elevated, AnFru, which has accumulated mostly in the medium, is promptly taken up and converted to AnGlc-ol, which accelerates glycogen degradation. We also suggest the possibility that AnGlc-ol is one of the extracellular signaling molecules for bacteria.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022254,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9880813,https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022254,Starch Oligomer,

19167225,Discovery of lignin in seaweed reveals convergent evolution of cell-wall architecture.,Current biology : CB,"Martone PT, Estevez JM, Lu F, Ruel K, Denny MW, Somerville C, Ralph J","Lignified cell walls are widely considered to be key innovations in the evolution of terrestrial plants from aquatic ancestors some 475 million years ago. Lignins, complex aromatic heteropolymers, stiffen and fortify secondary cell walls within xylem tissues, creating a dense matrix that binds cellulose microfibrils and crosslinks other wall components, thereby preventing the collapse of conductive vessels, lending biomechanical support to stems, and allowing plants to adopt an erect-growth habit in air. Although ""lignin-like"" compounds have been identified in primitive green algae, the presence of true lignins in nonvascular organisms, such as aquatic algae, has not been confirmed. Here, we report the discovery of secondary walls and lignin within cells of the intertidal red alga Calliarthron cheilosporioides. Until now, such developmentally specialized cell walls have been described only in vascular plants. The finding of secondary walls and lignin in red algae raises many questions about the convergent or deeply conserved evolutionary history of these traits, given that red algae and vascular plants probably diverged more than 1 billion years ago.",10.1016/j.cub.2008.12.031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19167225,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.cub.2008.12.031,Syringate,

PCA is further degraded via the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway, whereas 3MGA is metabolized via three distinct pathways in which PCA 4,5-dioxygenase (LigAB), 3MGA 3,4-dioxygenase (DesZ), and 3MGA O-demethylase (LigM) are involved. In the 3MGA O-demethylation pathway, LigM converts 3MGA to gallate, and the resulting gallate appears to be degraded by a dioxygenase other than LigAB or DesZ. Here, we isolated the gallate dioxygenase gene, desB, which encodes a 418-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 46,843 Da. The amino acid sequences of the N-terminal region (residues 1 to 285) and the C-terminal region (residues 286 to 418) of DesB exhibited ca. 40% and 27% identity with the sequences of the PCA 4,5-dioxygenase beta and alpha subunits, respectively. DesB produced in Escherichia coli was purified and was estimated to be a homodimer (86 kDa). DesB specifically attacked gallate to generate 4-oxalomesaconate as the reaction product. The K(m) for gallate and the V(max) were determined to be 66.9 +/- 9.3 microM and 42.7 +/- 2.4 U/mg, respectively. On the basis of the analysis of various SYK-6 mutants lacking the genes involved in syringate degradation, we concluded that (i) all of the three-ring cleavage dioxygenases are involved in syringate catabolism, (ii) the pathway involving LigM and DesB plays an especially important role in the growth of SYK-6 on syringate, and (iii) DesB and LigAB are involved in gallate degradation.",10.1128/JB.187.15.5067-5074.2005,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16030198,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.187.15.5067-5074.2005,Syringate,

Washed cell suspensions coupled the oxidation of hydrogen to enzymatic reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV), leading to the precipitation of TcO(2) at the periphery of the cell. An indirect, Fe(II)-mediated mechanism was also identified. Acetate, although not utilized efficiently as an electron donor for direct cell-mediated reduction of technetium, supported the reduction of Fe(III), and the Fe(II) formed was able to transfer electrons abiotically to Tc(VII). Tc(VII) reduction was comparatively inefficient via this indirect mechanism when soluble Fe(III) citrate was supplied to the cultures but was enhanced in the presence of solid Fe(III) oxide. The rate of Tc(VII) reduction was optimal, however, when Fe(III) oxide reduction was stimulated by the addition of the humic analog and electron shuttle anthaquinone-2,6-disulfonate, leading to the rapid formation of the Fe(II)-bearing mineral magnetite. Under these conditions, Tc(VII) was reduced and precipitated abiotically on the nanocrystals of biogenic magnetite as TcO(2) and was removed from solution to concentrations below the limit of detection by scintillation counting. Cultures of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria enriched from radionuclide-contaminated sediment using Fe(III) oxide as an electron acceptor in the presence of 25 microM Tc(VII) contained a single Geobacter sp. detected by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis and were also able to reduce and precipitate the radionuclide via biogenic magnetite. Fe(III) reduction was stimulated in aquifer material, resulting in the formation of Fe(II)-containing minerals that were able to reduce and precipitate Tc(VII). These results suggest that Fe(III)-reducing bacteria may play an important role in immobilizing technetium in sediments via direct and indirect mechanisms.",10.1128/AEM.66.9.3743-3749.2000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10966385,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.66.9.3743-3749.2000,Technetium Immobilization,

The selection of sampling sites was biased toward streams susceptible to contamination (i.e. downstream of intense urbanization and livestock production). OWCs were prevalent during this study, being found in 80% of the streams sampled. The compounds detected represent a wide range of residential, industrial, and agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 OWCs being found during this study. The most frequently detected compounds were coprostanol (fecal steroid), cholesterol (plant and animal steroid), N,N-diethyltoluamide (insect repellant), caffeine (stimulant), triclosan (antimicrobial disinfectant), tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (fire retardant), and 4-nonylphenol (nonionic detergent metabolite). Measured concentrations for this study were generally low and rarely exceeded drinking-water guidelines, drinking-water health advisories, or aquatic-life criteria. Many compounds, however, do not have such guidelines established. The detection of multiple OWCs was common for this study, with a median of seven and as many as 38 OWCs being found in a given water sample. Little is known about the potential interactive effects (such as synergistic or antagonistic toxicity) that may occur from complex mixtures of OWCs in the environment.

During the enrichment process in an anaerobic semi-continuous batch reactor, tetrabromobisphenol-A debromination gradually slowed down with concurrent accumulation of three intermediate products.

The ratio of the amount of (S)-1-tetralol to the amount of (R)-1-tetralol is small (approximately 0.04) and the reaction is essentially stereospecific. The reaction time-course plot indicates the formation of additional product(s) from the (R)-1-tetralol.

Approximate values of a Michaelis constant Km, limiting rate Vmax, and catalytic constant kcat are obtained for this reaction under a specified set of conditions. It is shown by means of a thermochemical cycle calculation that the apparent equilibrium constant for this reaction is approximately 4 x 10(65) at T = 298.15 K and pH 7.3.

These series of reactions begin with the condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to form trans-homoaconitate. The trans-homoaconitate is then hydrated and dehydrated to cis-homoaconitate with (S)-homocitrate serving as an intermediate. Rehydration of the cis-homoaconitate produces (-)-threo-isohomocitrate [(2R,3S)-1-hydroxy-1,2, 4-butanetricarboxylic acid], which undergoes a NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation to produce alpha-ketoadipate. The resulting alpha-ketoadipate then undergoes two consecutive sets of alpha-ketoacid chain elongation reactions to produce alpha-ketosuberate. In each of these sets of reactions, it has been shown that the homologues of cis-homoaconitate, homocitrate, and (-)-threo-isohomocitrate serve as intermediates. The protein product of the Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0503 gene aksA (AksA) was found to catalyze the condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to form trans-homoaconitate.

The alpha-ketosuberate resulting from this series of reactions then undergoes a nonoxidative decarboxylation to form 7-oxoheptanoic acid, a precursor to coenzyme B, and an oxidative decarboxylation to form pimelate, the precursor to biotin.

The reemergence of tuberculosis as a potential public health threat, the high susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons to the disease, and the proliferation of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains have created much scientific interest in developing new antimycobacterial agents to both treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to existing drugs, and shorten the duration of short-course treatment to improve patient compliance. Bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis is a proven target for new antibacterial drugs. Mycolic acids, which are key components of the mycobacterial cell wall, are alpha-alkyl, beta-hydroxy fatty acids, with a species-dependent saturated ""short"" arm of 20-26 carbon atoms and a ""long"" meromycolic acid arm of 50-60 carbon atoms. The latter arm is functionalized at regular intervals by cyclopropyl, alpha-methyl ketone, or alpha-methyl methylethers groups. The mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway has been proposed to involve five distinct stages: (i) synthesis of C20 to C26 straight-chain saturated fatty acids to provide the alpha-alkyl branch; (ii) synthesis of the meromycolic acid chain to provide the main carbon backbone, (iii) modification of this backbone to introduce other functional groups; (iv) the final Claisen-type condensation step followed by reduction; and (v) various mycolyltransferase processes to cellular lipids. The drugs shown to inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis are isoniazid, ethionamide, isoxyl, thiolactomycin, and triclosan. In addition, pyrazinamide was shown to inhibit fatty acid synthase type I which, in turn, provides precursors for fatty acid elongation to long-chain mycolic acids by fatty acid synthase II. Here we review the biosynthesis of mycolic acids and the mechanism of action of antimicrobial agents that act upon this pathway. In addition, we describe molecular modeling studies on InhA, the bona-fide target for isoniazid, which should improve our understanding of the amino acid residues involved in the enzyme's mechanism of action and, accordingly, provide a rational approach to the design of new drugs.",10.2174/1389201023378328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164478,https://sci-hub.se/10.2174/1389201023378328,Thioacetamide,

High-pressure liquid chromatographic methods were devised to study the potential influence of pharmacological factors on their in vivo activity. Fecal measurements suggested that all of the thioamides were well absorbed when fed in the diet. After intravenous administration, all of the thioamides were rapidly eliminated from the mouse. The differences in their elimination rates probably played only a minor role in affecting their relative antileprosy activities.

Synthesis of radiolabeled ETA and an examination of drug metabolites formed by whole cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) have allowed us to demonstrate that ETA is activated by S-oxidation before interacting with its cellular target. ETA is metabolized by MTb to a 4-pyridylmethanol product remarkably similar in structure to that formed by the activation of isoniazid by the catalase-peroxidase KatG. We have demonstrated that overproduction of Rv3855 (EtaR), a putative regulatory protein from MTb, confers ETA resistance whereas overproduction of an adjacent, clustered monooxygenase (Rv3854c, EtaA) confers ETA hypersensitivity. Production of EtaA appears to be negatively regulated by EtaR and correlates directly with [(14)C]ETA metabolism, suggesting that EtaA is the activating enzyme responsible for thioamide oxidation and subsequent toxicity. Coding sequence mutations in EtaA were found in 11 of 11 multidrug-resistant MTb patient isolates from Cape Town, South Africa.

The relative roles of CYP2E1 and FMO1 in the mechanism of TA-associated liver injury were investigated. In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, hepatic CYP2E1 protein concentration and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation were induced 8- and 5.6-fold, respectively. Pretreatment with the CYP2E1 inducer, isoniazid (INH, 250 mg/kg, i.p.) before TA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) administration significantly increased TA-associated liver injury as assessed by plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Hepatic CYP2E1 expression and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation were induced 2.2- and 2. 5-fold in the INH-pretreated rat, respectively. Inhibition of CYP2E1 by diallyl sulfide (DAS, 200 mg/kg, p.o., two doses) before TA administration, decreased plasma ALT activity by 60% in the nondiabetic rat and by 75% in the diabetic rat. Abolition of microsomal p-nitrophenol hydroxylation and CCl(4)-induced liver injury confirmed that hepatic CYP2E1 was highly inhibited by DAS. Hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) form 1 expression and methimazole-dependent oxidation of thiocholine were induced 2.5- and 1.8-fold in the diabetic rat, respectively. Dietary administration of 0.25% indole-3-carbinol (I3C) for 10 days inhibited FMO1 expression and enzyme activity in both nondiabetic and diabetic rats. Paradoxically, TA-induced liver injury was increased in these I3C-pretreated rats. These findings indicate that hepatic CYP2E1 appears to be primarily involved in bioactivation of TA. In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, diabetes-induced CYP2E1 appears to be responsible for the potentiated liver injury; Even though hepatic FMO1 is induced in the diabetic rat, it is unlikely to mediate the potentiated TA hepatotoxicity.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10900221,,Thioacetamide,

We present evidence of analogous molecules for copper transport from methane-oxidizing bacteria, represented here by a small fluorescent chromopeptide (C45N12O14H62Cu, 1216 daltons) produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. The crystal structure of this compound, methanobactin, was resolved to 1.15 angstroms. It is composed of a tetrapeptide, a tripeptide, and several unusual moieties, including two 4-thionyl-5-hydroxy-imidazole chromophores that coordinate the copper, a pyrrolidine that confers a bend in the overall chain, and an amino-terminal isopropylester group. The copper coordination environment includes a dual nitrogen- and sulfur-donating system derived from the thionyl imidazolate moieties.

The reemergence of tuberculosis as a potential public health threat, the high susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons to the disease, and the proliferation of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains have created much scientific interest in developing new antimycobacterial agents to both treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to existing drugs, and shorten the duration of short-course treatment to improve patient compliance. Bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis is a proven target for new antibacterial drugs. Mycolic acids, which are key components of the mycobacterial cell wall, are alpha-alkyl, beta-hydroxy fatty acids, with a species-dependent saturated ""short"" arm of 20-26 carbon atoms and a ""long"" meromycolic acid arm of 50-60 carbon atoms. The latter arm is functionalized at regular intervals by cyclopropyl, alpha-methyl ketone, or alpha-methyl methylethers groups. The mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway has been proposed to involve five distinct stages: (i) synthesis of C20 to C26 straight-chain saturated fatty acids to provide the alpha-alkyl branch; (ii) synthesis of the meromycolic acid chain to provide the main carbon backbone, (iii) modification of this backbone to introduce other functional groups; (iv) the final Claisen-type condensation step followed by reduction; and (v) various mycolyltransferase processes to cellular lipids. The drugs shown to inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis are isoniazid, ethionamide, isoxyl, thiolactomycin, and triclosan. In addition, pyrazinamide was shown to inhibit fatty acid synthase type I which, in turn, provides precursors for fatty acid elongation to long-chain mycolic acids by fatty acid synthase II. Here we review the biosynthesis of mycolic acids and the mechanism of action of antimicrobial agents that act upon this pathway. In addition, we describe molecular modeling studies on InhA, the bona-fide target for isoniazid, which should improve our understanding of the amino acid residues involved in the enzyme's mechanism of action and, accordingly, provide a rational approach to the design of new drugs.",10.2174/1389201023378328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164478,https://sci-hub.se/10.2174/1389201023378328,Thiobenzamide,

Antileprosy activity was evaluated in the mouse foot pad using both the kinetic and continuous methods. Ethionamide and prothionamide were found to be the most active compounds and to be of approximately equal potency. Thioisonicotinamide was about five times less active. 2-t-Butyl-thioisonicotinamide, 2-dimethylamino-thioisonicotinamide, and pyrazine carbonic thioamide were inactive at the dosages tested. High-pressure liquid chromatographic methods were devised to study the potential influence of pharmacological factors on their in vivo activity. Fecal measurements suggested that all of the thioamides were well absorbed when fed in the diet. After intravenous administration, all of the thioamides were rapidly eliminated from the mouse. The differences in their elimination rates probably played only a minor role in affecting their relative antileprosy activities. It was concluded that the structural requirements for antileprosy and antituberculosis activity of the thioamides are probably similar.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3910748,,Thiobenzamide,

The relative roles of CYP2E1 and FMO1 in the mechanism of TA-associated liver injury were investigated. In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, hepatic CYP2E1 protein concentration and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation were induced 8- and 5.6-fold, respectively. Pretreatment with the CYP2E1 inducer, isoniazid (INH, 250 mg/kg, i.p.) before TA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) administration significantly increased TA-associated liver injury as assessed by plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Hepatic CYP2E1 expression and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation were induced 2.2- and 2. 5-fold in the INH-pretreated rat, respectively. Inhibition of CYP2E1 by diallyl sulfide (DAS, 200 mg/kg, p.o., two doses) before TA administration, decreased plasma ALT activity by 60% in the nondiabetic rat and by 75% in the diabetic rat. Abolition of microsomal p-nitrophenol hydroxylation and CCl(4)-induced liver injury confirmed that hepatic CYP2E1 was highly inhibited by DAS. Hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) form 1 expression and methimazole-dependent oxidation of thiocholine were induced 2.5- and 1.8-fold in the diabetic rat, respectively. Dietary administration of 0.25% indole-3-carbinol (I3C) for 10 days inhibited FMO1 expression and enzyme activity in both nondiabetic and diabetic rats. Paradoxically, TA-induced liver injury was increased in these I3C-pretreated rats. These findings indicate that hepatic CYP2E1 appears to be primarily involved in bioactivation of TA. In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, diabetes-induced CYP2E1 appears to be responsible for the potentiated liver injury; Even though hepatic FMO1 is induced in the diabetic rat, it is unlikely to mediate the potentiated TA hepatotoxicity.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10900221,,Thiobenzamide,

Under similar conditions, TBSO is converted solely to BA.

Cell-free extracts of the organism catalysed the release of (14)CO(2) from thiophen-2-[(14)C]carboxylate. This activity was largely dependent on the presence of ATP and CoA and was stimulated by NAD(+) and Mg(2+). Inclusion of hydroxylamine resulted in the appearance of thiophen-2-carbohydroxamic acid, indicating that the ATP and CoA were involved in the formation of the CoA ester of thiophen-2-carboxylate. 5. High-speed centrifuging of cell-free extracts resulted in supernatants with decreased thiophen-2-carboxylate-degrading activity. Activity was restored by the addition of the high-speed pellet or by Methylene Blue. 6. The metabolism of the CoA ester of thiophen-2-carboxylate by cell-free extracts could be linked to the anaerobic reduction of Methylene Blue. 7. The sulphur atom of the thiophen nucleus was converted into sulphate by growing cultures and resting suspensions of the organism. 8. A degradative pathway is proposed involving the hydroxylation (at C-5) of the CoA ester of thiophen-2-carboxylate followed by further metabolism to 2-oxoglutarate and sulphate.",10.1042/bj1340353,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16742794,https://sci-hub.se/10.1042/bj1340353,Thiophene-2-carboxylate,

The isolate, strain NKK, was a motile, oxidase- and catalase-positive, rod-like bacterium with a G+C content of 61.7 mol%. Besides nitrate, oxygen could serve as a terminal electron acceptor. Among many carbon sources tested, only a few sugars, fatty acids, and thiophene-2-carboxylate supported growth. Other heterocyclic compounds were not used. The sulfur atom of thiophene-2-carboxylate was oxidized to thiosulfate when cells were grown aerobically, or to elemental sulfur when cells were grown anaerobically with nitrate. Nitrate was reduced to nitrite. Growth on thiophene-2-carboxylate was dependent on the addition of molybdate to the medium. Tungstate, a specific antagonist of molybdate, inhibited growth on thiophene-2-carboxylate at concentrations > 10(-7) M. Three inducible enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiophene-2-carboxylate were detected: an ATP-, CoA-, thiophene-2-carboxylate- and Mg2+-dependent thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming), a molybdenum-containing thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and a thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA thioesterase.

Genetic studies have suggested that this monooxygenase consists of two different proteins, products of the xylA and xylM genes, which function as an electron-transfer protein and a terminal hydroxylase, respectively. In this study, the electron-transfer component of xylene monooxygenase, the product of xylA, was purified to homogeneity. Fractions containing the xylA gene product were identified by its NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 40 kDa by SDS/PAGE, and 42 kDa by gel filtration. The enzyme was found to contain 1 mol/mol of tightly but not covalently bound FAD, as well as 2 mol/mol of non-haem iron and 2 mol/mol of acid-labile sulfide, suggesting the presence of two redox centers, one FAD and one [2Fe-2S] cluster/protein molecule. The oxidised form of the protein had absorbance maxima at 457 nm and 390 nm, with shoulders at 350 nm and 550 nm. These absorbance maxima disappeared upon reduction of the protein by NADH or dithionite. The NADH:acceptor reductase was capable of reducing either one- or two-electron acceptors, such as horse heart cytochrome c or 2,6-dichloroindophenol, at an optimal pH of 8.5. The reductase was found to have a Km value for NADH of 22 microM. The oxidation of NADH was determined to be stereospecific; the enzyme is pro-R (class A enzyme). The titration of the reductase with NADH or dithionite yielded three distinct reduced forms of the enzyme: the reduction of the [2Fe-2S] center occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -171 mV; and the reduction of FAD to FAD. (semiquinone form), with a calculated midpoint redox potential of -244 mV. The reduction of FAD. to FAD.. (dihydroquinone form), the last stage of the titration, occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -297 mV. The [2Fe-2S] center could be removed from the protein by treatment with an excess of mersalyl acid. The [2Fe-2S]-depleted protein was still reduced by NADH, giving rise to the formation of the anionic flavin semiquinone observed in the native enzyme, thus suggesting that the electron flow was NADH --> FAD --> [2Fe-2S] in this reductase. The resulting protein could no longer reduce cytochrome c, but could reduce 2,6-dichloroindophenol at a reduced rate.",10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17260.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1327782,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17260.x,Toluene,

This strain has also been shown to contain two extrachromosomal elements of < 70 and > 100 kb. A derivative strain cured of the largest plasmid, PR1(23) Cure, was unable to grow on phenol or toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy, which requires expression of the Tom pathway. Transfer of the larger plasmid from strain G4 (the parent strain inducible for Tom) enabled PR1(23) Cure to grow on toluene or phenol via inducible Tom pathway expression. Conjugal transfer of TOM23c from PR1(23) to an antibiotic-resistant derivative of PR1(23) Cure enabled the transconjugant to grow with either phenol or toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy through constitutive expression of the Tom pathway. A cloned 11.2-kb EcoRI restriction fragment of TOM23c resulted in the expression of both Tom and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in Escherichia coli, as evidenced by its ability to oxidize trichloroethylene, toluene, m-cresol, o-cresol, phenol, and catechol. The largest resident plasmid of PR1 was identified as the source of these genes by DNA hybridization. These results indicate that the genes which encode Tom and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase are located on TOM, an approximately 108-kb degradative plasmid of B. cepacia G4.",10.1128/aem.61.4.1352-1356.1995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7538275,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.61.4.1352-1356.1995,Toluene,

A subclone of pRO1957, designated pRO1966, when present in P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in lactate-toluene medium, accumulates m-cresol in the medium, indicating that m-cresol is an intermediate of toluene catabolism. Moreover, incubation of such cells in the presence of 18O2 followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of m-cresol extracts showed that the oxygen in m-cresol was derived from molecular oxygen. Accordingly, this suggests that toluene-3-monooxygenation is the first step in the degradative pathway. Toluene-3-monooxygenase activity is positively regulated from a locus designated tbuT. Induction of the toluene-3-monooxygenase is mediated by either toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene, or m-cresol. Moreover, toluene-3-monooxygenase activity induced by these effectors also metabolizes benzene and ethylbenzene to phenol and 3-ethylphenol, respectively, and also after induction, o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene are metabolized to 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, and 2,5-dimethylphenol, respectively, although the xylene substrates are not effectors.

The initial step of the pathway is hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol by a multicomponent toluene-4-monooxygenase (T4MO) system. The T4MO enzyme system has broad substrate specificity and provides a new opportunity for biodegradation of toxic compounds and bioconversions. Its known activities include conversion of a variety of phenyl compounds into the phenolic derivatives and the complete degradation of trichloroethylene. We have cloned and characterized a gene cluster from KR1 that determines the offO activity. To clone the T4MO genes, KR1 DNA libraries were constructed in Escherichia coli HB101 by using a broad-host-range vector and transferred to a KR1 mutant able to grow on p-cresol but not on toluene. An insert consisting of two SacI fragments of identical size (10.2 kb) was shown to complement the mutant for growth on toluene. One of the SacI fragments, when cloned into the E. coli vector pUC19, was found to direct the synthesis of indigo dye. The indigo-forming property was correlated with the presence of T4MO activity. The T4MO genes were mapped to a 3.6-kb region, and the direction of transcription was determined. DNA sequencing and N-terminal amino acid determination identified a five-gene cluster, tmoABCDE, within this region. Expression of this cluster carrying a single mutation in each gene demonstrated that each of the five genes is essential for T4MO activity. Other evidence presented indicated that none of the tmo genes was involved in the regulation of the tmo gene cluster, in the control of substrate transport for the T4MO system, or in major processing of the products of the tmo genes. It was tentatively concluded that the tmoABCDE genes encode structural polypeptides of the T4MO enzyme system.

In addition, the enzyme catalyzed dioxygen addition to the nonaromatic double bond of indene to form cis-1,2-indandiol. The oxygen atoms in 1-indenol and cis-1,2-indandiol were shown to be derived from molecular oxygen, whereas 70% of the oxygen in 1-indanol was derived from water. All of the isolated products were optically active as demonstrated by 19F NMR and HPLC discrimination of diastereomeric esters and by chiroptic methods. The high optical purity of (-)-(1R)-indanol (84% enantiomeric excess) and the failure of scavengers of reactive oxygen species to inhibit the monooxygenation reaction supported the contention that the monooxygen insertion is mediated by an active-site process. Experiments with 3-[2H]indene indicated that equilibration between C-1 and C-3 occurred prior to the formation of the carbon-oxygen bond to yield 1-indenol. Naphthalene dioxygenase also oxidized indan to 1-indanol, which suggested that benzylic monoxygenation may be typical of this group of dioxygenases.",10.1021/bi00404a041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3365392,https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/bi00404a041,Toluene,

This reaction was not dependent on the presence of coenzyme A (CoA) or ATP. In the presence of CoA, formation of E-phenylitaconate from benzylsuccinate was also observed. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the specific rate of benzylsuccinate formation from toluene and fumarate in assays with permeabilized cells was >30% of the specific rate of toluene consumption in whole-cell suspensions with nitrate; this observation suggests that benzylsuccinate formation may be the first reaction in anaerobic toluene degradation by strain T. Use of deuterium-labeled toluene and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that the H atom abstracted from the toluene methyl group during addition to fumarate was retained in the succinyl moiety of benzylsuccinate. In this study, no evidence was found to support previously proposed reactions of toluene with acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA. Toluene-grown, permeabilized cells of strain T also catalyzed the addition of o-xylene to fumarate to form (2-methylbenzyl)succinate. o-Xylene is not a growth substrate for strain T, and its transformation was probably cometabolic. With the exception of specific reaction rates, the observed characteristics of the toluene-fumarate addition reaction (i.e., retention of a methyl H atom and independence from CoA and ATP) also apply to the o-xylene-fumarate addition reaction. Thus, addition to fumarate may be a biochemical strategy to anaerobically activate a range of methylbenzenes.",10.1128/jb.179.3.670-676.1997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9006019,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.179.3.670-676.1997,Toluene (anaerobic),

Toluene first becomes oxidized to benzoyl-CoA by O2-independent reactions. Benzoyl-CoA is then reduced to non-aromatic products by benzoyl-CoA reductase. We set out to study the reactions employed for the initial activation of toluene and its oxidation to the level of benzoate. Evidence is provided for a novel way of toluene degradation based on experiments with cell-free extracts and with whole toluene-grown cells: Cell-free extracts oxidized [14C]toluene to [14C]benzoyl-CoA via several radioactive intermediates. This reaction was strictly dependent on the presence of fumarate, coenzyme A and nitrate as electron acceptor; acetyl-CoA and ATP were not necessary for the reaction. The first product formed in vitro was benzylsuccinate; (2H8)toluene was converted to (2H7)benzylsuccinate. Formation of benzylsuccinate from toluene was independent of coenzyme A and nitrate, but it required the presence of fumarate. Other tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were converted to fumarate in cell extracts and therefore could partially substitute for fumarate. [14C]Benzylsuccinate was oxidized further to [14C]benzoyl-CoA and [14C]benzoate in cell extracts if coenzyme A and nitrate were present. No benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde and no phenylpropionate could be detected as intermediates. In isotope trapping experiments with cell suspensions, two intermediates from [14C]toluene were detected, benzoate and benzylsuccinate. This corroborates the sequence of reactions deduced from in vitro experiments. A hypothetical degradation pathway for the anaerobic oxidation of toluene to benzoyl-CoA via an initial addition of fumarate to the methyl group of toluene and following beta-oxidation of the benzylsuccinate formed is suggested.",10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0661w.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8706665,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0661w.x,Toluene (anaerobic),

In several instances their genes have been cloned and analysed. For phosphonate xenobiotics, the enzyme system responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus bond has not yet been observed in vitro, though much is understood on a genetic level about phosphonate degradation. Phosphonate metabolism is regulated as part of the Pho regulon, under phosphate starvation control. For organophosphorothionate pesticides the situation is not so clear, and the mode of regulation appears to depend on whether the compounds are utilized to provide phosphorus, carbon or sulfur for cell growth. The same is true for organosulfonate metabolism, where different (and differently regulated) enzymatic pathways are involved in the utilization of sulfonates as carbon and as sulfur sources, respectively. Observations at the protein level in a number of bacteria suggest that a regulatory system is present which responds to sulfate limitation and controls the synthesis of proteins involved in providing sulfur to the cell and which may reveal analogies between the regulation of phosphorus and sulfur metabolism.",10.1111/j.1574-6976.1994.tb00135.x,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7946467,https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1574-6976.1994.tb00135.x,Toluene-4-sulfonate,

The degradative pathway(s) in 2AS-grown cells are initiated with membrane transport, NADH-dependent dioxygenation and meta ring cleavage. The specific activity of the NADH-dependent dioxygenation(s) varied with the growth phase and was maximal near the end of exponential growth for each growth substrate. Cells were harvested at this point from BS-, TS- and 2AS-salts medium. Cells grown with each sulphonated substrate could oxygenate all three compounds, but only 2AS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol 2AS or BS or TS. BS- and TS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol BS or TS but failed to oxygenate the product of oxygenation of 2AS, 3-sulphocatechol (3SC). These observations were repeated with cell extracts and we concluded that there were two sets of desulphonative pathways in the organism, one for 2AS and one for BS and TS. We confirmed this hypothesis by separating the degradative enzymes from 2AS-, BS- or TS-grown cells. A 2AS dioxygenase system and a 3SC-2,3-dioxygenase (3SC23O) were detected in 2AS-grown cells only. In both BS- and TS-grown cells a dioxygenase system for BS and TS was observed as well as a principal catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O-III), neither of which was present in 2AS-grown cells. The 3SC23O was purified to near homogeneity, found to be monomeric (M(r) 42,000), and to catalyse 2,3-dioxygenation to a product that decayed spontaneously to sulphite and 2-hydroxymuconate. The 2AS dioxygenase system could cause not only deamination of 2AS but also desulphonation of BS and TS. The BS dioxygenase could desulphonate BS and apparently either desulphonate or deaminate 2AS. Strain O-1 thus seems to contain two putative, independently regulated operons involving oxygenation and spontaneous desulphonation(s). One operon encodes at least the 2AS dioxygenase system and 3SC23O whereas the other encodes at least the BS/TS dioxygenase system and C23O-III.",10.1099/13500872-140-7-1713,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8075807,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/13500872-140-7-1713,Toluene-4-sulfonate,

The reduction of the nitro groups seems to be the dominating mechanism, whereas hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, as described for picric acid, appears to be of minor importance. Thus, two bacterial strains enriched with TNT as a sole source of nitrogen under aerobic conditions, a gram-negative strain called TNT-8 and a gram-positive strain called TNT-32, carried out nitro-group reduction. In contrast, both a picric acid-utilizing Rhodococcus erythropolis strain, HL PM-1, and a 4-nitrotoluene-utilizing Mycobacterium sp. strain, HL 4-NT-1, possessed reductive enzyme systems, which catalyze ring hydrogenation, i.e., the addition of a hydride ion to the aromatic ring of TNT. The hydride-Meisenheimer complex thus formed (H-TNT) was further converted to a yellow metabolite, which by electrospray mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analyses was established as the protonated dihydride-Meisenheimer complex of TNT (2H-TNT). Formation of hydride complexes could not be identified with the TNT-enriched strains TNT-8 and TNT-32, or with Pseudomonas sp. clone A (2NT), for which such a mechanism has been proposed. Correspondingly, reductive denitration of TNT did not occur.",10.1128/AEM.64.1.246-252.1998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16349484,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.64.1.246-252.1998,Trinitrotoluene,

E. cloacae PB2 was found to be capable of slow aerobic growth with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the sole nitrogen source. Dinitrotoluenes were not produced and could not be used as nitrogen sources. Purified PETN reductase was found to reduce TNT to its hydride-Meisenheimer complex, which was further reduced to the dihydride-Meisenheimer complex.

An isolated strain, strain CNR15, was identified as Pseudomonas chlororaphis on the basis of its morphological and biochemical features. The incubation of strain CNR15 in a medium containing glycerol, succinate, and 130 microM TPT resulted in the rapid degradation of TPT and the accumulation of approximately 40 microM DPT as the only metabolite after 48 h. The culture supernatants of strain CNR15, grown with or without TPT, exhibited a TPT degradation activity, whereas the resting cells were not capable of degrading TPT. TPT was stoichiometrically degraded to DPT by the solid-phase extract of the culture supernatant, and benzene was detected as another degradation product. We found that the TPT degradation was catalyzed by low-molecular-mass substances (approximately 1,000 Da) in the extract, termed the TPT-degrading factor. The other fluorescent pseudomonads, P. chlororaphis ATCC 9446, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692, also showed TPT degradation activity similar to strain CNR15 in the solid-phase extracts of their culture supernatants.

The H2-dependent U(VI) reductase activity in the soluble fraction of the cells was lost when the soluble fraction was passed over a cationic exchange column which extracted cytochrome c3. Addition of cytochrome c3 back to the soluble fraction that had been passed over the cationic exchange column restored the U(VI)-reducing capacity. Reduced cytochrome c3 was oxidized by U(VI), as was a c-type cytochrome(s) in whole-cell suspensions. When cytochrome c3 was combined with hydrogenase, its physiological electron donor, U(VI) was reduced in the presence of H2. Hydrogenase alone could not reduce U(VI). Rapid U(VI) reduction was followed by a subsequent slow precipitation of the U(IV) mineral uraninite. Cytochrome c3 reduced U(VI) in a uranium-contaminated surface water and groundwater. Cytochrome c3 provides the first enzyme model for the reduction and biomineralization of uranium in sedimentary environments. Furthermore, the finding that cytochrome c3 can catalyze the reductive precipitation of uranium may aid in the development of fixed-enzyme reactors and/or organisms with enhanced U(VI)-reducing capacity for the bioremediation of uranium-contaminated waters and waste streams.",10.1128/aem.59.11.3572-3576.1993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8285665,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.59.11.3572-3576.1993,Uranium,

Under strict anaerobic conditions, D. radiodurans R1 reduced Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid coupled to the oxidation of lactate to CO(2) and acetate but was unable to link this process to growth. D. radiodurans reduced the humic acid analog anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) to its dihydroquinone form, AH(2)DS, which subsequently transferred electrons to the Fe(III) oxides hydrous ferric oxide and goethite via a previously described electron shuttle mechanism. D. radiodurans reduced the solid-phase Fe(III) oxides in the presence of either 0.1 mM AQDS or leonardite humic acids (2 mg ml(-1)) but not in their absence. D. radiodurans also reduced U(VI) and Tc(VII) in the presence of AQDS. In contrast, Cr(VI) was directly reduced in anaerobic cultures with lactate although the rate of reduction was higher in the presence of AQDS. The results are the first evidence that D. radiodurans can reduce Fe(III) coupled to the oxidation of lactate or other organic compounds.

An enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been purified 360-fold from S. viridifaciens. This enzyme, isobutylamine N-hydroxylase, catalyzes the oxidation of isobutylamine to isobutylhydroxylamine in the presence of oxygen and a reduced flavin cofactor. Unlike other known N-hydroxylases, isobutylamine N-hydroxylase cannot carry out the reduction of the flavin cofactor. Rather, the reduced flavin is supplied by a separate flavin reductase that is present in extracts of S. viridifaciens. The reduced flavin cofactor could also be supplied by the flavin mononucleotide reductase of Vibrio fischeri. The requirement for molecular oxygen and a reduced flavin indicates that the N-hydroxylase is a flavin monooxygenase and that the mechanism for the hydroxylation is likely to proceed via the formation of a flavin 4a-hydroperoxide.

In contrast to earlier studies, this study achieved a clear temporal separation of growing cells devoid of secondary metabolism-specific enzymes from nongrowing cells, which rapidly produce these enzymes. A spore inoculum, silicone-treated flasks, and two new media which supported a rapid, pellet-free, filamentous type of growth were used. In yeast extract-glucose-buffer medium, a marked drop in the specific growth rate (approximately equal to 0.26 h-1) coincided with the appearance of the first pathway-specific enzyme, 6-methylsalicylic acid synthetase, at about 19 h after inoculation. About 3 h later, when replicatory growth had ceased entirely, the sparsely branched mycelia (length, approximately equal to 550 microns) began the rapid synthesis of a later pathway enzyme, m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase. A similar sequence of events occurred in a defined nitrate-glucose-buffer medium; 12 other strains or isolates of P. urticae, as well as some patulin-producing aspergilli, behaved in a similar manner. The age at which a culture produced m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was increased by increasing the nutrient nitrogen content of the medium or by decreasing the size of the spore inoculum.

The study was focused on possible reaction steps that follow the initial formation of (1-methylpentyl)succinate from n-hexane and fumarate. 4-Methyloctanoic, 4-methyloct-2-enoic, 2-methylhexanoic, 2-methylhex-2-enoic and 3-hydroxy-2-methylhexanoic acids (in addition to a few other methyl-branched acids) were detected in n-hexane-grown but not in n-hexanoate-grown cultures. Labeling indicated preservation of the original carbon chain of n-hexane in these acids. Tracing of the deuterium label of 3- d1-(1-methylpentyl)succinate in tentative subsequent products indicated a deuterium/carboxyl carbon exchange in the succinate moiety. This suggests that the metabolism of (1-methylpentyl)succinate employs reactions analogous to those in the established conversion of succinyl-CoA via methylmalonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA. Accordingly, a pathway is proposed in which (1-methylpentyl)succinate is converted to the CoA-thioester, rearranged to (2-methylhexyl)malonyl-CoA and decarboxylated (perhaps by a transcarboxylase) to 4-methyloctanoyl-CoA. The other identified fatty acids match with a further degradation of 4-methyloctanoyl-CoA via rounds of conventional beta-oxidation.

Of 27 microbial strains tested, only 9 were found to use any of the branched hydrocarbons tested as a sole carbon source, and then only those hydrocarbons containing at least one iso-terminus were susceptible to degradation. Anteiso-or isopropenyl termini prevented biodegradation. None of the hydrocarbonoclastic yeasts tested was able to utilize branched-hydrocarbon growth sustrates. In the case of pseudomonads containing the OCT plasmid, whole-cell oxidation of n-octane was poorly induced by terminally branched dimethyloctanes. In the presence of a gratuitous inducer of the octane-oxidizing enzymes, the iso-branched 2,7-dimethyloctane was slowly oxidized by whole cells, whereas the anteiso-branched 3,6-dimethyloctane was not oxidized at all.

8555199,Flavin-dependent alkyl hydroperoxide reductase from Salmonella typhimurium. 2. Cystine disulfides involved in catalysis of peroxide reduction.,Biochemistry,Poole LB,"The two-component alkyl hydroperoxide reductase enzyme system from Salmonella typhimurium catalyzes the pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of alkyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide substrates. This system is composed of a flavoenzyme, AhpF, which is related to the disulfide-reducing enzyme thioredoxin reductase, and a smaller protein, AhpC, which lacks a chromophoric cofactor. We have demonstrated that NADH-linked reduction of AhpF under anaerobic conditions converts two cystine disulfide centers to their dithiol forms. The AhpC cystine disulfide center, shown to exist as an intersubunit disulfide bond, is stoichiometrically reducible by NADH in the presence of a catalytic amount of AhpF and can be reoxidized by ethyl hydroperoxide. Disulfide bridges within oxidized AhpF form between Cys129 and Cys132 and between Cys345 and Cys348; the two C-terminal half-cystine residues, Cys476 and Cys489, exist as free thiol groups in oxidized AhpF and play no role in catalysis. Removal of the N-terminal 202-amino acid segment containing the Cys129-Cys132 disulfide center obliterates the ability of AhpF to transfer electrons to 5,5'-dthiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and AhpC. NADH added anaerobically to AhpF causes spectral changes consistent with preferential reduction of both disulfides relative to flavin reduction; the reduction potentials of the disulfide centers are thus appropriately poised for electron transfer from NADH and flavin to disulfide-containing substrates (AhpC or DTNB), and ultimately to peroxides from AhpC. Blue, neutral flavin semiquinone is also generated in high yields during reductive titrations (91% yield during dithionite titrations), although the relatively slow formation of this species indicates its catalytic incompetence. A long wavelength absorbance band beyond 900 nm attributable to an FADH2-->NAD+ charge transfer interaction is generated during NADH, but not dithionite, titrations and may be indicative of a species directly involved in the catalytic cycle. A catalytic mechanism including the transient formation of cysteine sulfenic acid within AhpC is proposed.",10.1021/bi951888k,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8555199,https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/bi951888k,n-Octane,

The gene cluster, designated nbaEXHJIGFCDR, is organized tightly and in the same direction. The nbaC and nbaD gene products were found to be novel homologs of the eukaryotic 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase and 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase, respectively.

The NbaC and NbaD proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. The substrate specificity of the 23.8-kDa NbaC protein was found to be restricted to 3-hydroxyanthranilate. In E. coli, this enzyme oxidizes 3-hydroxyanthranilate with a specific activity of 8 U/mg of protein. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed the essential role of two conserved histidine residues (His52 and His96) in the NbaC sequence. The NbaC activity is also dependent on the presence of Fe(2+) but is inhibited by other metal ions, such as Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and Cd(2+).

The cym operon, encoding the conversion of p-cymene to p-cumate, is located just upstream of the cmt operon, which encodes the further catabolism of p-cumate and is located, in turn, upstream of the tod (toluene catabolism) operon in P. putida F1. The sequences of an 11,236-bp DNA segment carrying the cym operon and a 915-bp DNA segment completing the sequence of the 2,673-bp DNA segment separating the cmt and tod operons have been determined and are discussed here. The cym operon contains six genes in the order cymBCAaAbDE. The gene products have been identified both by functional assays and by comparing deduced amino acid sequences to published sequences. Thus, cymAa and cymAb encode the two components of p-cymene monooxygenase, a hydroxylase and a reductase, respectively; cymB encodes p-cumic alcohol dehydrogenase; cymC encodes p-cumic aldehyde dehydrogenase; cymD encodes a putative outer membrane protein related to gene products of other aromatic hydrocarbon catabolic operons, but having an unknown function in p-cymene catabolism; and cymE encodes an acetyl coenzyme A synthetase whose role in this pathway is also unknown. Upstream of the cym operon is a regulatory gene, cymR. By using recombinant bacteria carrying either the operator-promoter region of the cym operon or the cmt operon upstream of genes encoding readily assayed enzymes, in the presence or absence of cymR, it was demonstrated that cymR encodes a repressor which controls expression of both the cym and cmt operons and is inducible by p-cumate but not p-cymene.

A 35.75-kb DNA segment, within which the cmt operon encoding the catabolism of p-cumate is located, was cloned as four separate overlapping restriction fragments and mapped with restriction endonucleases. By examining enzyme activities in recombinant bacteria carrying these fragments and sub-cloned fragments, genes encoding most of the enzymes of the p-cumate pathway were located. Subsequent sequence analysis of 11,260 bp gave precise locations of the 12 genes of the cmt operon. The first three genes, cmtAaAbAc, and the sixth gene, cmtAd, encode the components of p-cumate 2,3-dioxygenase (ferredoxin reductase, large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, and ferredoxin, respectively); these genes are separated by cmtC, which encodes 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate 3,4-dioxygenase, and cmtB, coding for 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase. The ring cleavage product, 2-hydroxy-3-carboxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate, is acted on by a decarboxylase encoded by the seventh gene, cmtD, which is followed by a large open reading frame, cmtI, of unknown function. The next four genes, cmtEFHG, encode 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate hydrolase, 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, which transform the decarboxylation product to amphibolic intermediates. The deduced amino acid sequences of all the cmt gene products except CmtD and CmtI have a recognizable but low level of identity with amino acid sequences of enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions in other catabolic pathways. This identity is highest for the last two enzymes of the pathway (4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase [acylating]), which have identities of 66 to 77% with the corresponding enzymes from other aromatic meta-cleavage pathways. Recombinant bacteria carrying certain restriction fragments bordering the cmt operon were found to transform indole to indigo.

7783002,Phenol and cresol metabolism in Bacillus pumilus isolated from contaminated groundwater.,Journal of basic microbiology,"Günther K, Schlosser D, Fritsche W","From an aquifier contaminated with phenolic compounds seven bacterial strains able to grow on phenol and several mono- and disubstituted alkylphenols as sole source of carbon and energy were isolated. Five isolates belong to the genus Pseudomonas, two to the genus Bacillus. The isolate most active in utilization of the applied xenobiotics was identified as Bacillus pumilus and used for the investigation of the degradation pathways in liquid cultures. Cells of this strain precultured on phenol were able to utilize para-cresol as sole carbon source via the oxidation of the methylsubstituent and intradiol ring cleavage of the resulting protocatechuic acid, whereas an intradiol ring fission of the intermediate 4-methylcatechol led to 4-methylmuconolactone as dead end-product. Cells precultured on meta- and ortho-cresol were able to utilize the respective compounds as sole carbon sources via 3-methylcatechol, which induced the following extradiol ring fission pathway. Cells precultured on phenol were able to cooxidize meta- as well as ortho-cresol to 3-methylcatechol, which was cleaved via an intradiol ring fission, finally leading to the dead end-product 2-methylmuconolactone.",10.1002/jobm.3620350205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7783002,https://sci-hub.se/10.1002/jobm.3620350205,p-Xylene,
9461415,Characterization of a gene cluster from Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 encoding metabolism of 4-methylmuconolactone.,Gene,"Erb RW, Timmis KN, Pieper DH","A 2,585 bp chromosomal DNA segment of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (formerly: Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134) which contains a gene cluster encoding part of the modified ortho-cleavage pathway encodes a putative transport protein for 4-methylmuconolactone, a novel 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase and methylmuconolactone isomerase. The putative 4-methylmuconolactone transporter, a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 45.8 kDa, exhibits sequence homology to other members of the major superfamily of transmembrane facilitators and shows the common structural motif of 12 transmembrane-spanning alpha-helical segments and the hallmark amino acid motif characteristic of the superfamily. Consistent with the novelty of the reaction catalyzed by 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase, no primary sequence homologies were found between this enzyme or its gene and other proteins or genes in the data banks, suggesting that this enzyme represents a new type of isomerase. The molecular mass of the native 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase was determined by gel filtration analysis to be 25 +/- 2 kDa. From the polynucleotide sequence of the gene, a molecular mass of 12.9 kDa was calculated and hence we predict a homodimeric quaternary structure. The high sensitivity of 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase to heavy metals and thiol-modifying reagents implicates the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic reaction. The methylmuconolactone isomerase - calculated molecular mass 10.3 kDa - has a primary structure related to the classical muconolactone isomerases (EC 5.3.3.4) of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, of two Pseudomonas putida strains and of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134, suggesting that these are all isoenzymes. Consistent with this proposal is the finding that the purified protein exhibits muconolactone-isomerizing activity.",10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00565-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9461415,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00565-9,p-Xylene,
16145546,Isolation and characterization of a rhodococcus species strain able to grow on ortho- and para-xylene.,"Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)","Jang JY, Kim D, Bae HW, Choi KY, Chae JC, Zylstra GJ, Kim YM, Kim E","Rhodococcus sp. strain YU6 was isolated from soil for the ability to grow on o-xylene as the sole carbon and energy source. Unlike most other o-xylene-degrading bacteria, YU6 is able to grow on p-xylene. Numerous growth substrate range experiments, in addition to the ring-cleavage enzyme assay data, suggest that YU6 initially metabolizes o- and p-xylene by direct aromatic ring oxidation. This leads to the formation of dimethylcatechols, which was further degraded largely through meta-cleavage pathway. The gene encoding meta-cleavage dioxygenase enzyme was PCR cloned from genomic YU6 DNA using previously known gene sequence data from the o-xylene-degrading Rhodococcus sp. strain DK17. Subsequent sequencing of the 918-bp PCR product revealed a 98% identity to the gene, encoding methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase from DK17. PFGE analysis followed by Southern hybridization with the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene demonstrated that the gene is located on an approximately 560-kb megaplasmid, designated pJYJ1.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16145546,,p-Xylene,
