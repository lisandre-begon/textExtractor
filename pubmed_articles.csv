8515237,Diketocamphane enantiomer-specific 'Baeyer-Villiger' monooxygenases from camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453.,Journal of general microbiology,"Jones KH, Smith RT, Trudgill PW","Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 grew with either (+)- or (-)-camphor as sole carbon source. Enantiomer-specific 'biological Baeyer-Villiger' monooxygenases were synthesized irrespective of the camphor isomer used for growth. The two enzymes are probably the products of separate genes but showed many similarities. Each consisted of two electrophoretically identical subunits, bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) non-covalently and accepted electrons from an induced NADH dehydrogenase which interacted with the FMN bound to the oxygenating component. They showed minor differences in M(r) with 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase being the smaller enzyme. Isoelectric focussing showed the two enzymes to have different acidic pI values. Polyclonal antibodies raised against 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase also cross-reacted with 2,5-diketocamphane 1,2-monooxygenase and its subunits.",10.1099/00221287-139-4-797,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/00221287-139-4-797,(+)-Camphor
6848481,"Camphor revisited: involvement of a unique monooxygenase in metabolism of 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid by Pseudomonas putida.",Journal of bacteriology,"Ougham HJ, Taylor DG, Trudgill PW","Previously, Pseudomonas putida was shown to degrade (+)-camphor, and cleavage of the first ring of the bicyclic structure involved two monooxygenases (a hydroxylase and a ring oxygen-inserting enzyme), a dehydrogenase, and spontaneous cleavage of an unstable oxygenation product (lactone). Cleavage of the second ring was not demonstrated but was assumed also to occur by ring oxygen insertion, since the predicted oxygenation product was extracted from whole-cell incubation systems. Our investigation established that metabolism of the first ring cleavage intermediate, 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid, occurred through the sequential action of two inducible enzymes, a coenzyme A ester synthetase and an oxygenase. The oxygenase was purified to homogeneity and had a molecular weight of 106,000. This enzyme carried a single molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide and consisted of two identical subunits. Iron was not present at a significant level. The oxygenase was specific for NADPH as the electron donor and absolutely specific for the coenzyme A ester of 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid as the substrate. The reaction stoichiometry was compatible with this enzyme being a monooxygenase, and a mass spectral analysis of the methyl ester of the product confirmed the insertion of a single oxygen atom. The enzyme appeared to be analogous to, although distinct from. 2,5-diketocamphane 1,2-monooxygenase in catalyzing a ""biological Baeyer-Villiger"" reaction with the formation of a lactone. Structural analogy suggested that this lactone, like the first, was also unstable and susceptible to spontaneous ring opening, although this was not experimentally established.",10.1128/jb.153.1.140-152.1983,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.153.1.140-152.1983,(+)-Camphor

Laboratory experiments with DDE-containing marine sediments showed that DDE is dechlorinated to DDMU in both methanogenic and sulfidogenic microcosms and that DDD is dehydrochlorinated to DDMU three orders of magnitude more slowly. Thus, DDD does not appear to be an important precursor of the DDMU found in these sediments.

In this study, we investigated the ability of Pseudomonas acidovorans M3GY to transform DDE and its unchlorinated analog, 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE). While strain M3GY could grow on DPE, cells grown on DPE as a sole carbon source could not degrade DDE. Cells grown on biphenyl, however, did degrade DDE. Mass balance analysis of [14C]DDE showed transformation of more than 40% of the recoverable radioactivity. Nine chlorinated metabolites produced from DDE were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (GC-MS-FTIR) from cultures grown on biphenyl. Recovery of these metabolites demonstrates that biphenyl-grown cells degrade DDE through a meta-fission pathway.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization of the neutral extracts revealed two hydroxy-DDT intermediates (m/z = 370) with retention times at 19.55 and 19.80 min that shared identical mass spectra. This result suggested that the hydroxylations occurred at the ortho and meta positions on the aromatic ring. UV-visible spectrum spectrophotometric analysis of a yellow metabolite in the culture supernatant showed a maximum A402 with, under acidic and basic conditions, spectrophotometric characteristics similar to those of the aromatic ring meta-cleavage products. 4-Chlorobenzoic acid was detected by thin-layer chromatography radiochemical scanning in samples from mineralization experiments by comparison of Rf values of [14C]DDT intermediates with that of an authentic standard. These results were further confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This study indicates that DDT appears to be oxidized by a dioxygenase in A. eutrophus A5 and that the products of this oxidation are subsequently subjected to ring fission to eventually yield 4-chlorobenzoic acid as a major stable intermediate.",10.1128/aem.60.1.51-55.1994,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/aem.60.1.51-55.1994,"1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis-(4`-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)"

TCA was also converted to acetic acid and 1,1-dichloroethene (11DCE) by cell-free extract. 11DCE was further biologically converted to ethene. This pathway was confirmed by transformation tests of TCA, DCA and CA, by tests with cell-free extract, and by chloride release during TCA degradation. With cell-free extract, acetic acid accounted for approximately 90% of the TCA transformed; tests with live cells indicate that the fraction of TCA transformed by this pathway decreased with lower biomass.

TCE degradation was a strictly cometabolic process, requiring the presence of a cosubstrate, preferably formate, and oxygen. M. trichosporium OB3b cells degraded TCE only when grown under copper limitation and when the soluble methane monooxygenase was derepressed. During TCE degradation, nearly total dechlorination occurred, as indicated by the production of inorganic chloride, and only traces of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and trichloroacetaldehyde were produced. TCE degradation proceeded according to first-order kinetics from 0.1 to 0.0002 mM TCE with a rate constant of 2.14 ml min-1 mg of cells-1. TCE concentrations above 0.2 mM inhibited degradation in cell suspensions of 0.42 mg of cells ml-1. Other chlorinated aliphatics were also degraded by M. trichosporium OB3b.

These chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) are often found together as cocontaminants in groundwater. The maximum degradation rates (k(max)) and half-saturation coefficients (K(s)) were determined in single compound kinetic tests. The highest k(max) was obtained for butane (2.6 micromol/mg TSS/h) followed by 1,1-DCE (1.3 micromol/mg TSS/h), 1,1-DCA (0.49 micromol/mg TSS/h), and 1,1,1-TCA (0.19 micromol/mg TSS/h), while the order of K(s) from the highest to lowest was 1,1-DCA (19 microM), butane (19 microM), 1,1,1-TCA (12 microM) and 1,1-DCE (1.5 microM). The inhibition types were determined using direct linear plots, while inhibition coefficients (K(ic) and K(iu)) were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression (NLSR) fits to the kinetic model of the identified inhibition type. Two different inhibition types were observed among the compounds. Competitive inhibition among CAHs was indicated from direct linear plots, and the CAHs also competitively inhibited butane utilization. 1,1-DCE was a stronger inhibitor than the other CAHs. Mixed inhibition of 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1-DCA, and 1,1-DCE transformations by butane was observed. Thus, both competitive and mixed inhibitions are important in cometabolism of CAHs by this butane culture. For competitive inhibition between CAHs, the ratio of the K(s) values was a reasonable indicator of competitive inhibition observed. Butane was a strong inhibitor of CAH transformation, having a much lower inhibition coefficient than the K(s) value of butane, while the CAHs were weak inhibitors of butane utilization. Model simulations of reactor systems where both the growth substrate and the CAHs are present indicate that reactor performance is significantly affected by inhibition type and inhibition coefficients.

They were further characterized by cloning in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, and Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP222. Expression studies in these organisms showed that the upper-pathway genes (tcbA and tcbB) code for the conversion of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, respectively, by means of a dioxygenase system and a dehydrogenase. The lower-pathway genes have the order tcbC-tcbD-tcbE and encode a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase II, a cycloisomerase II, and a hydrolase II, respectively.

The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the conversion of 1,2-DCE to glycolic acid have been isolated. The haloalkane dehalogenase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase are plasmid encoded. Two other enzymes, the alcohol dehydrogenase and the haloacid dehalogenase, are chromosomally encoded. Sequence analysis indicates that the haloacid dehalogenase belongs to the L-specific 2-chloroproprionic acid dehalogenases.

The epoxide hydrolase gene coded for a protein of 294 amino acids with a molecular mass of 34 kDa. An identical epoxide hydrolase gene was cloned from chromosomal DNA of the closely related strain A. radiobacter CFZ11. The recombinant epoxide hydrolase was expressed up to 40% of the total cellular protein content in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and the purified enzyme had a kcat of 21 s-1 with epichlorohydrin. Amino acid sequence similarity of the epoxide hydrolase with eukaryotic epoxide hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, and bromoperoxidase A2 from Streptomyces aureofaciens indicated that it belonged to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family. This conclusion was supported by secondary structure predictions and analysis of the secondary structure with circular dichroism spectroscopy. The catalytic triad residues of epoxide hydrolase are proposed to be Asp107, His275, and Asp246. Replacement of these residues to Ala/Glu, Arg/Gln, and Ala, respectively, resulted in a dramatic loss of activity for epichlorohydrin.

Strain 170 was also able to grow on 3-chloroallyl alcohol, 3-chloroacrylic acid, and several 1-halo-n-alkanes. This organism produced at least three different dehalogenases: a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase specific for haloalkanes and two 3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenases, one specific for cis-3-chloroacrylic acid and the other specific for trans-3-chloroacrylic acid. The haloalkane dehalogenase and the trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase were expressed constitutively, whereas the cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase was inducible. The presence of these enzymes indicates that 1, 3-dichloropropene is hydrolyzed to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, which is oxidized in two steps to 3-chloroacrylic acid. The latter compound is then dehalogenated, probably forming malonic acid semialdehyde.

Monooxygenase-expressing bacteria have been shown to degrade dioxane via growth-supporting as well as cometabolic mechanisms. In this study, the intermediates of dioxane degradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria were determined by triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. The major intermediates were identified as 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), ethylene glycol, glycolate, and oxalate. Studies with uniformly labeled 14C dioxane showed that over 50% of the dioxane was mineralized to CO2 by CB1190, while 5% became biomass-associated after 48 h. Volatile organic acids and non-volatiles, respectively, accounted for 20 and 11% of the radiolabeled carbon. Although strains cometabolizing dioxane exhibited limited transformation capacities, nearly half of the initial dioxane was recovered as CO2. On the basis of these analytical results, we propose a pathway for dioxane oxidation by monooxygenase-expressing cells in which dioxane is first converted to 2-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane, which is spontaneously oxidized to HEAA. During a second monooxygenation step, HEAA is further hydroxylated, resulting in a mixture of dihydroxyethoxyacetic acids with a hydroxyl group at the ortho or para position. After cleavage of the second ether bond, small organic molecules such as ethylene glycol, glycolate, glyoxalate, and oxalate are progressively formed, which are then mineralized to CO2 via common cellular metabolic pathways.

The nucleotide sequence of a 5.5-kb chromosomal fragment from B. cepacia AC1100 which complemented PT88 for growth on 2,4,5-T was determined. The sequence revealed the presence of six open reading frames, designated ORF1 to ORF6. Five polypeptides were produced when this DNA region was under control of the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli; however, no polypeptide was produced from the fourth open reading frame, ORF4. Homology searches of protein sequence databases were performed to determine if the proteins involved in 2,4,5-T metabolism were similar to other biodegradative enzymes. In addition, complementation studies were used to determine which genes were essential for the metabolism of 2,4,5-T. The first gene of the cluster, ORF1, encoded a 37-kDa polypeptide which was essential for complementation of PT88 and showed significant homology to putative trans-chlorodienelactone isomerases. The next gene, ORF2, was necessary for complementation and encoded a 47-kDa protein which showed homology to glutathione reductases. ORF3 was not essential for complementation; however, both the 23-kDa protein encoded by ORF3 and the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF4 showed homology to glutathione S-transferases.

The degradative pathway(s) in 2AS-grown cells are initiated with membrane transport, NADH-dependent dioxygenation and meta ring cleavage. The specific activity of the NADH-dependent dioxygenation(s) varied with the growth phase and was maximal near the end of exponential growth for each growth substrate. Cells were harvested at this point from BS-, TS- and 2AS-salts medium. Cells grown with each sulphonated substrate could oxygenate all three compounds, but only 2AS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol 2AS or BS or TS. BS- and TS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol BS or TS but failed to oxygenate the product of oxygenation of 2AS, 3-sulphocatechol (3SC). These observations were repeated with cell extracts and we concluded that there were two sets of desulphonative pathways in the organism, one for 2AS and one for BS and TS.

In Tris buffer, the separated 3SC23O catalysed the reaction of 1 mol each of 3SC and O2 involving a transient yellow intermediate, and release of 1 mol of sulphite and two organic products. The major product was identified by n.m.r. and by g.c./m.s. as 5-carboxypenta-2,4-dien-5-olide (CPDO), an indicator of formation of 2-hydroxymuconic acid (2HM). The second product was identified as the Z,E isomer of 2HM by comparison with authentic material. When the CPDO in the product mixture was chemically hydrolysed to (Z,E)-2HM, 1 mol of (Z,E)-2HM/mol of 3SC was observed. If oxygenation of 3SC by 3SC23O was carried out in phosphate buffer, only a single product was detected, a keto form of 2HM. This dioate was also formed from authentic (Z,E)-2HM in phosphate buffer. Formation of the natural product (Z,E)-2HM from the xenobiotic, 3SC, seems to involve oxygenation to the unstable 2-hydroxy-6-sulphonomuconic acid semialdehyde, which hydrolyses spontaneously to 2HM. There would appear to be at least one spontaneous reaction per enzyme reaction in this pathway.",10.1042/bj3000429,https://sci-hub.se/10.1042/bj3000429,2-Aminobenzenesulfonate

1592816,Anaerobic degradation of 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) via benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA in a denitrifying bacterium.,Journal of bacteriology,"Lochmeyer C, Koch J, Fuchs G","The enzymes catalyzing the initial reactions in the anaerobic degradation of 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) were studied with a denitrifying Pseudomonas sp. anaerobically grown with 2-aminobenzoate and nitrate as the sole carbon and energy sources. Cells grown on 2-aminobenzoate are simultaneously adapted to growth with benzoate, whereas cells grown on benzoate degrade 2-aminobenzoate several times less efficiently than benzoate. Evidence for a new reductive pathway of aromatic metabolism and for four enzymes catalyzing the initial steps is presented. The organism contains 2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase), which forms 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA. 2-Aminobenzoyl-CoA is then reductively deaminated to benzoyl-CoA by an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reductase (deaminating), which requires a low potential reductant [Ti(III)]. The specific activity is 15 nmol of 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 mg-1 of protein at an optimal pH of 7. The two enzymes are induced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions only. Benzoyl-CoA is further converted in vitro by reduction with Ti(III) to six products; the same products are formed when benzoyl-CoA or 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA is incubated under reducing conditions. Two of them were identified preliminarily. One product is cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, the other is trans-2-hydroxycyclohexane-carboxyl-CoA. The complex transformation of benzoyl-CoA is ascribed to at least two enzymes, benzoyl-CoA reductase (aromatic ring reducing) and cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase. The reduction of benzoyl-CoA to alicyclic compounds is catalyzed by extracts from cells grown anaerobically on either 2-aminobenzoate or benzoate at almost the same rate (10 to 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein). In contrast, extracts from cells grown anaerobically on acetate or grown aerobically on benzoate or 2-aminobenzoate are inactive. This suggests a sequential induction of the enzymes.",10.1128/jb.174.11.3621-3628.1992,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.174.11.3621-3628.1992,2-Aminobenzoate (anaerobic)

Using these substrates and also NADH, it was found that their oxidation was also inhibited using isolated membrane fragments of Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans. Methylene blue reduction was also found to be inhibited. The oxidation of ascorbate was not inhibited in P. denitrificans. From these results it is suggested that MBT might interact with the respiratory chain at the level of flavoproteins or quinones and Fe-S clusters.",10.1007/BF00173931,https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/BF00173931,2-Mercaptobenzothiazole

Aerobic degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at the surface is well documented and it has long been thought that the flow of oxygen- and nutrient-bearing meteoric waters into reservoirs was necessary for in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation. The occurrence of biodegraded oils in reservoirs where aerobic conditions are unlikely, together with the identification of several anaerobic microorganisms in oil fields and the discovery of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation mechanisms, suggests that anaerobic degradation processes could also be responsible. The extent of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation processes in the world's deep petroleum reservoirs, however, remains strongly contested. Moreover, no organism has yet been isolated that has been shown to degrade hydrocarbons under the conditions found in deep petroleum reservoirs. Here we report the isolation of metabolites indicative of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation from a large fraction of 77 degraded oil samples from both marine and lacustrine sources from around the world, including the volumetrically important Canadian tar sands. Our results therefore suggest that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation is a common process in biodegraded subsurface oil reservoirs.",10.1038/nature02922,https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/nature02922,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic)

Metabolite analyses revealed two groups of degradation products. The first group comprised two succinic acid adducts which were identified as naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid and naphthyl-2-methylene-succinic acid by comparison with chemically synthesized reference compounds. Naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid accumulated to 0.5 microM in culture supernatants. Production of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was analyzed in enzyme assays with dense cell suspensions. The conversion of 2-methylnaphthalene to naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was detected at a specific activity of 0.020 +/- 0.003 nmol min(-1) mg of protein(-1) only in the presence of cells and fumarate. We conclude that under anaerobic conditions 2-methylnaphthalene is activated by fumarate addition to the methyl group, as is the case in anaerobic toluene degradation. The second group of metabolites comprised 2-naphthoic acid and reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives, including 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, octahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid.

11440239,Evidence for aromatic ring reduction in the biodegradation pathway of carboxylated naphthalene by a sulfate reducing consortium.,Biodegradation,"Zhang X, Sullivan ER, Young LY","Naphthalene was used as a model compound in order to study the anaerobic pathway of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation. Previously we had determined that carboxylation is an initial step for anaerobic metabolism of naphthalene, but no other intermediate metabolites were identified (Zhang & Young 1997). In the present study we further elucidate the pathway with the identification of six novel naphthalene metabolites detected when cultures were fed naphthalene in the presence of its analog 1 -fluoronaphthalene. Results from cultures supplemented with either deuterated naphthalene or non-deuterated naphthalene plus [13C]bicarbonate confirm that the metabolites originated from naphthalene. Three of these metabolites were identified by comparison with the following standards: 2-naphthoic acid (2-NA), 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid. The presence of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-NA as a metabolite of naphthalene degradation indicates that the first reduction reaction occurs at the unsubstituted ring, rather than the carboxylated ring. The overall results suggest that after the initial carboxylation of naphthalene, 2-NA is sequentially reduced to decahydro-2-naphthoic acid through 5 hydrogenation reactions, each of which eliminated one double bond. Incorporation of deuterium atoms from D2O into 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid suggests that water is the proton source for hydrogenation.",10.1023/a:1011128109670,https://sci-hub.se/10.1023/a:1011128109670,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic)
15500985,Enzymatic reactions in anaerobic 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by the sulphate-reducing enrichment culture N 47.,FEMS microbiology letters,"Safinowski M, Meckenstock RU","The upper pathway of anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was studied with a sulphate-reducing enrichment culture, which is able to grow with naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene as sole carbon source and electron donor. Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene is initiated by an addition of fumarate to the methyl-group producing the first intermediate, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate. In a subsequent beta-oxidation of the original methyl atom, the central metabolite 2-naphthoic acid is generated. In the following pathway, the aromatic ring system is reduced, cleaved, and finally oxidised to CO(2). Here, we present two new enzymatic reactions of the 2-methylnaphthalene degradation pathway that were measured in crude cell extracts. All metabolites were identified with HPLC by co-elution with synthesised reference substances. The first enzyme, succinyl-CoA:naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate CoA-transferase, catalyses the activation of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid to the corresponding CoA ester. The average specific activity of this enzyme was 19.6 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1). The CoA-transfer was not inhibited by sodium borohydride and only partially by hydroxylamine, indicating that this enzyme belongs to the family III of CoA-transferases like the corresponding enzyme in the anaerobic toluene degradation pathway. The product of this CoA-transfer reaction, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA is then oxidised in a reaction to naphthyl-2-methylene-succinyl-CoA by the enzyme naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA dehydrogenase.

Degradation studies with tetralin revealed 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid as a major metabolite indicating activation by addition of a C(1) unit to tetralin, comparable to the formation of 2-naphthoic acid in anaerobic naphthalene degradation. The activation reaction was specific for the aromatic ring of tetralin; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid was not detected. The reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives tetrahydro-, octahydro-, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid were identified consistently in supernatants of cultures grown with either naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, or tetralin. In addition, two common ring cleavage products were identified. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-resolution GC-MS analyses revealed a compound with a cyclohexane ring and two carboxylic acid side chains as one of the first ring cleavage products. The elemental composition was C(11)H(16)O(4) (C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid), indicating that all carbon atoms of the precursor 2-naphthoic acid structure were preserved in this ring cleavage product. According to the mass spectrum, the side chains could be either an acetic acid and a propenic acid, or a carboxy group and a butenic acid side chain. A further ring cleavage product was identified as 2-carboxycyclohexylacetic acid and was assumed to be formed by beta-oxidation of one of the side chains of the C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid. Stable isotope-labeling growth experiments with either (13)C-labeled naphthalene, per-deuterated naphthalene-d(8), or a (13)C-bicarbonate-buffered medium showed that the ring cleavage products derived from the introduced carbon source naphthalene. The series of identified metabolites suggests that anaerobic degradation of naphthalenes proceeds via reduction of the aromatic ring system of 2-naphthoic acid to initiate ring cleavage in analogy to the benzoyl-coenzyme A pathway for monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Our findings provide strong indications that further degradation goes through saturated compounds with a cyclohexane ring structure and not through monoaromatic compounds. A metabolic pathway for anaerobic degradation of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 2-naphthoic acid as the central intermediate is proposed.",10.1128/AEM.68.2.852-858.2002,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.68.2.852-858.2002,2-Methylnaphthalene (anaerobic)

Rats were pre-treated with a single dose of 2-NP (100 mg/kg body weight dissolved in canola oil). Afterward, the animals were post-treated with a dose of diphenyl diselenide (10, 50 or 100 micromol/kg). The parameters that indicate tissue damage such as liver histopathology, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), urea and creatinine were determined. Since the liver damage induced by 2-NP is related to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbic acid level were also evaluated. Diphenyl diselenide (50 and 100 micromol/kg) effectively restored the increase of ALT and AST activities and urea level when compared to the 2-NP group. At the higher dose, diphenyl diselenide decreased GGT activity. Treatment with diphenyl diselenide, at all doses, effectively ameliorated the increase of hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation when compared to 2-NP group. 2-NP reduced CAT activity and neither alter SOD activity nor ascorbic acid level. This study points out the involvement of CAT activity in 2-NP-induced acute liver damage and suggests that the post-treatment with diphenyl diselenide was effective in restoring the hepatic damage induced by 2-NP.",10.1016/j.cbi.2005.12.010,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.cbi.2005.12.010,2-Nitropropane

The enzyme is composed of two subunits; the molecular weight of each subunit is approximately 40,000. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of nitroalkanes to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds. It acts on 2-nitropropane better than on nitroethane and 1-nitropropane, and anionic forms of nitroalkanes are much better substrates than are neutral forms. The enzyme does not act on aromatic compounds. When the enzyme reaction was conducted in an 18O2 atmosphere with the anionic form of 2-nitropropane as the substrate, acetone (with a molecular mass of 60 Da) was produced. This indicates that the oxygen atom of acetone was derived from molecular oxygen, not from water; hence, the enzyme is an oxygenase. The reaction stoichiometry was 2CH3CH(NO2)CH3 + O2-->2CH3COCH3 + 2HNO2, which is identical to that of the reaction of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Hansenula mrakii. The reaction of the Neurospora enzyme was inhibited by superoxide anion scavengers in the same manner as that of the Hansenula enzyme. Both of these enzymes are flavoenzymes; however, the Neurospora enzyme contains flavin mononucleotide as a prosthetic group, whereas the Hansenula enzyme contains flavin adenine dinucleotide.",10.1128/AEM.64.3.1029-1033.1998,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.64.3.1029-1033.1998,2-Nitropropane

To identify genes coding for enzymes of DTDP catabolism, Tn5::mob-induced mutants of T. mimigardefordensis were generated. Screening of transposon mutant libraries yielded many mutants fully or partially impaired in utilizing DTDP as a carbon source. Mapping of the insertion loci in some mutants identified four disrupted open reading frames (ORFs) with putative metabolic functions. The ORFs were assigned function on the basis of homologies with lpdA (EC 1.8.1.4), cdo (EC 1.13.11.20), sucCD (EC 6.2.1.5), and acnB (EC 4.2.1.3). Tn5::mob insertions occurred additionally in the vicinity of heat shock protein-encoding genes. The predicted function of the LpdA homologue in T. mimigardefordensis is cleavage of the disulfide bond of DTDP to form two molecules of 3MP. Cdo catalyzes the conversion of the sulfhydryl group of 3MP, yielding the corresponding sulfinic acid, 3SP. SucCD exhibits thiokinase activity, ligating coenzyme A (CoA) with 3SP to form 3SP-CoA. Afterwards, an elimination of sulfite via a putative desulfinase is expected. acnB encodes a putative 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase. Therefore, a new pathway is proposed for the catabolism of DTDP via 3MP, 3SP, and 3SP-CoA toward propionyl-CoA, which is then further catabolized via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle in T. mimigardefordensis.",10.1128/AEM.00422-08,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/AEM.00422-08,"3,3`-Dithiodipropionate"

The enzyme is found in a degradative pathway for the xenobiotic nematocide trans-1,3-dichloropropene. MSAD has no sequence homology to previously characterized decarboxylases, but the presence of a conserved motif (Pro1-(X)8 -Gly-Arg11-X-Asp-X-Gln) in its N-terminal region suggested a relationship to the tautomerase superfamily. Sequence analysis identified Pro1 and Arg75 as potential active site residues that might be involved in the MSAD activity. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the importance of these residues to activity and provided further evidence to implicate MSAD as a new member of the tautomerase superfamily. MSAD is the first identified decarboxylase in the superfamily and is possibly the first characterized member of a new and distinct family within this superfamily. Malonate semialdehyde is analogous to a beta-keto acid, and enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of these acids generally utilize metal ion catalysis, a Schiff base intermediate, or polarization of the carbonyl group by hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions. A mechanistic analysis shows that the rate of the reaction is not affected by the presence of a metal ion or EDTA while the incubation of MSAD with the substrate in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride results in the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The site of modification is Pro1. These observations are consistent with the latter two mechanisms, but do not exclude the first mechanism. Based on the sequence analysis, the outcome of the mutagenesis and mechanistic experiments, and the roles determined for Pro1 and the conserved arginine in all tautomerase superfamily members characterized thus far, two mechanistic scenarios are proposed for the MSAD-catalyzed reaction in which Pro1 and Arg75 play prominent roles.",10.1074/jbc.M306706200,https://sci-hub.se/10.1074/jbc.M306706200,3-Chloroacrylic Acid

A catabolic pathway for the isomeric fluorobenzoates is proposed on the basis of key metabolites isolated. Only 4-fluorobenzoate was utilized and totally degraded after a short period of adaptation. The isoenzymes for total degradation of chlorocatechols, being found during growth with 3-chlorobenzoate or 4-chlorophenol, were not induced in the presence of fluorobenzoates. Correspondingly, only the ordinary enzymes of the benzoate pathway were detected in 4-fluorobenzoate-grown cells.

Here we describe the isolation of a bacterium capable of using 3-fluorobenzoate as a sole source of carbon and energy, and the experiments conducted to define the steps involved in the biodegradation of this compound. The organism was identified as a strain belonging to the genus Sphingomonas by sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA gene. To date no other organism from this genus is known to degrade this compound. Using fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F NMR) to analyse the culture supernatant it was possible to observe the disappearance of 3-fluorobenzoate and the appearance of fluoride ion and four other fluorinated compounds. These were identified as 3-fluorocatechol, 2-fluoromuconic acid and 3- and 5-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxybenzoates.

Nitration was not mediated by a free radical mechanism because hydroxyl radical scavengers did not reduce either superoxide dismutase or Fe3+EDTA-catalyzed nitration and nitrogen dioxide was not a significant product from either catalyst. Rather, metal ions appear to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite to form a nitronium-like species (NO2+). The calculated energy for separating peroxynitrous acid into hydroxide ion and nitronium ion is 13 kcal.mol-1 at pH 7.0. Fe3+EDTA catalyzed nitration with an activation energy of 12 kcal.mol-1 at a rate of 5700 M-1.s-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5. The reaction rate of peroxynitrite with bovine Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase was 10(5) M-1.s-1 at low superoxide dismutase concentrations, but the rate of nitration became independent of superoxide dismutase concentration above 10 microM with only 9% of added peroxynitrite yielding nitrophenol. We propose that peroxynitrite anion is more stable in the cis conformation, whereas only a higher energy species in the trans conformation can fit in the active site of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. At high superoxide dismutase concentrations, phenolic nitration may be limited by the rate of isomerization from the cis to trans conformations of peroxynitrite as well as by competing pathways for peroxynitrite decomposition. In contrast, Fe3+EDTA appears to react directly with the cis anion, resulting in greater nitration yields.",10.1016/0003-9861(92)90432-v,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/0003-9861(92)90432-v,3-Nitrotyrosine Family

Herein, we show that extracellular 3-nitrotyrosine is transported via the l-aromatic amino acid transporter in nondopaminergic NT2 cells, whereas in dopaminergic PC12 cells, it is transported by both the l-aromatic amino acid and the dopamine transporters. In both cell lines, 3-nitrotyrosine is a substrate for tyrosine tubulin ligase, resulting in its incorporation into the C terminus of alpha-tubulin. In NT2 cells, incorporation of 3-nitrotyrosine into alpha-tubulin induces a progressive, reversible reorganization of the microtubule architecture. In PC12 cells, 3-nitrotyrosine decreases intracellular dopamine levels and is metabolized by the concerted action of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase. Intracellular levels of 133 micromol of 3-nitrotyrosine per mole of tyrosine did not alter NT2 viability but induced PC12 apoptosis. The cell death was reversed by caspases and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 3-Nitrotyrosine induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive primary rat neurons, which was also prevented by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor.

During growth on 3-nitrotyrosine stoichiometric amounts of nitrite were released along with approximately one-half of the theoretically available ammonia.

9603882,Characterization of the hca cluster encoding the dioxygenolytic pathway for initial catabolism of 3-phenylpropionic acid in Escherichia coli K-12.,Journal of bacteriology,"Díaz E, Ferrández A, García JL","We have identified, cloned, and sequenced the hca cluster encoding the dioxygenolytic pathway for initial catabolism of 3-phenylpropionic acid (PP) in Escherichia coli K-12. This cluster maps at min 57.5 of the chromosome and is composed of five catabolic genes arranged as a putative operon (hcaA1A2CBD) and two additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction that encode a potential permease (hcaT) and a regulator (hcaR). Sequence comparisons revealed that while hcaA1A2CD genes encode the four subunits of the 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase, the hcaB gene codes for the corresponding cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. This type of catabolic module is homologous to those encoding class IIB dioxygenases and becomes the first example of such a catabolic cluster in E. coli. The inducible expression of the hca genes requires the presence of the hcaR gene product, which acts as a transcriptional activator and shows significant sequence similarity to members of the LysR family of regulators. Interestingly, the HcaA1A2CD and HcaB enzymes are able to oxidize not only PP to 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) but also cinnamic acid (CI) to its corresponding 2, 3-dihydroxy derivative. Further catabolism of DHPP requires the mhp-encoded meta fission pathway for the mineralization of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP) (A. Ferrández, J. L. García, and E. Díaz, J. Bacteriol. 179:2573-2581, 1997). Expression in Salmonella typhimurium of the mhp genes alone or in combination with the hca cluster allowed the growth of the recombinant bacteria in 3-hydroxycinnamic acid (3HCI) and CI, respectively. Thus, the convergent mhp- and hca-encoded pathways are also functional in S. typhimurium, and they are responsible for the catabolism of different phenylpropanoid compounds (3HPP, 3HCI, PP, and CI) widely available in nature.",10.1128/JB.180.11.2915-2923.1998,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/JB.180.11.2915-2923.1998,3-Phenylpropionate

9699867,An updated review of environmental estrogen and androgen mimics and antagonists.,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,"Sonnenschein C, Soto AM","For the last 40 y, substantial evidence has surfaced on the hormone-like effects of environmental chemicals such as pesticides and industrial chemicals in wildlife and humans. The endocrine and reproductive effects of these chemicals are believed to be due to their ability to: (1) mimic the effect of endogenous hormones, (2) antagonize the effect of endogenous hormones, (3) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of endogenous hormones, and (4) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of hormone receptors. The discovery of hormone-like activity of these chemicals occurred long after they were released into the environment. Aviation crop dusters handling DDT were found to have reduced sperm counts, and workers at a plant producing the insecticide kepone were reported to have lost their libido, became impotent and had low sperm counts. Subsequently, experiments conducted in lab animals demonstrated unambiguously the estrogenic activity of these pesticides. Man-made compounds used in the manufacture of plastics were accidentally found to be estrogenic because they fouled experiments conducted in laboratories studying natural estrogens. For example, polystyrene tubes released nonylphenol, and polycarbonate flasks released bisphenol-A. Alkylphenols are used in the synthesis of detergents (alkylphenol polyethoxylates) and as antioxidants. These detergents are not estrogenic; however, upon degradation during sewage treatment they may release estrogenic alkylphenols. The surfactant nonoxynol is used as intravaginal spermicide and condom lubricant. When administered to lab animals it is metabolized to free nonylphenol. Bisphenol-A was found to contaminate the contents of canned foods; these tin cans are lined with lacquers such as polycarbonate. Bisphenol-A is also used in dental sealants and composites. We found that this estrogen leaches from the treated teeth into saliva; up to 950 microg of bisphenol-A were retrieved from saliva collected during the first hour after polymerization. Other xenoestrogens recently identified among chemicals used in large volumes are the plastizicers benzylbutylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, the antioxidant butylhydroxyanisole, the rubber additive p-phenylphenol and the disinfectant o-phenylphenol. These compounds act cumulatively. In fact, feminized male fish were found near sewage outlets in several rivers in the U.K.; a mixture of chemicals including alkyl phenols resulting from degradation of detergents during sewage treatment seemed to be the causal agent. Estrogen mimics are just a class of endocrine disruptors. Recent studies identified antiandrogenic activity in environmental chemicals such as vinclozolin, a fungicide, and DDE, and insecticide. Moreover, a single chemical may produce neurotoxic, estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects. It has been hypothesized that endocrine disruptors may play a role in the decrease in the quantity and quality of human semen during the last 50 y, as well as in the increased incidence of testicular cancer and cryptorchidism in males and breast cancer incidence in both females and males in the industrialized word. To explore this hypothesis it is necessary to identify putative causal agents by the systematic screening of environmental chemicals and chemicals present in human foods to assess their ability to disrupt the endocrine system. In addition, it will be necessary to develop methods to measure cumulative exposure to (a) estrogen mimics, (b) antiandrogens, and (c) other disruptors.",10.1016/s0960-0760(98)00027-2,https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/s0960-0760(98)00027-2,"4-(1-Ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)phenol"

Our results clearly show that the alkyl cation derived from the alpha-quaternary nonylphenol 4-(1-ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-phenol through ipso-hydroxylation and subsequent dissociation of the 4-alkyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexadienone intermediate preferentially combines with a molecule of water to yield the corresponding alcohol and hydroquinone. However, the metabolism of certain alpha,alpha-dimethyl-substituted nonylphenols appears to also involve a reaction of the cation with the ipso-hydroxy group to form the corresponding 4-alkoxyphenols. Growth, oxygen uptake, and 18O-labeling experiments clearly indicate that strain Bayram metabolized 4-t-butoxyphenol by ipso-hydroxylation to a hemiketal followed by spontaneous dissociation to the corresponding alcohol and p-quinone. Hydroquinone effected high oxygen uptake in assays with induced resting cells as well as in assays with cell extracts.

This is despite the fact that FOCs have been used in a wide variety of products and applications for more than 50 years. FOCs are resistant to hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation, or metabolism by vertebrates due to the high energy of carbon-fluorine bond. In particular, perfluorinated (fully fluorinated) compounds (PFCs) have the potential to persist in the environment. But, until recently, the extent and magnitude of environmental distribution of PFCs was unknown.

It displays a restricted growth spectrum, being unable to grow on a wide range of alternative alicyclic alcohols and ketones. Cyclohexanol-grown cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of 230 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt with the consumption of 5.65 mumol of O2/mumol substrate. Cyclohexanone is oxidized at a similar rate with the consumption of 4.85 mumol of O2/mumol. 1-Oxa-2-oxocycloheptane and 6-hydroxyhexanoate are both oxidized at the same slow rate of 44 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt and adipate is not oxidized. Studies with cell extracts reveal the presence of inducible dehydrogenases for cyclohexanol, 6-hydroxyhexanoate and 6-oxohexanoate and a monooxygenase, that in conjunction with a lactonase converts cyclohexanone to 6-hydroxyhexanoate.

Enzyme stability is maintained by the addition of ethanol, EDTA, and dithiothreitol. Stoichiometric studies show that for 1 mol of undecyl acetate formed, 1 mol of O2 is consumed and 1 mol of NADPH is oxidized. The monooxygenase, purified to homogeneity, has a molecular weight of approximately 123,000 and consists of two equal subunits with molecular weights of 55,000. The enzyme contains FAD and exhibits absorption maxima at 375 and 488 nm. Enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-active reagents and the inhibition by the cations, cadmium, copper, zinc, and mercury, is reversed by dithiothreitol, indicating the presence of essential sulfhydryl groups. Substrate specificity tests show that acetate esters are formed from methyl ketones from C-7 through C-14. The oxygenase is also active on isomers of 2-tridecanone forming esters from 3- through 7-tridecanone. With 6-tridecanone, two esters are formed, heptyl hexanoate and pentyl octanoate, indicating that oxygen is inserted on either side of the carbonyl group.

Several species of micro-organisms that were capable of utilizing pyridine compounds as carbon and energy source were isolated from soil and sewage. Compounds degraded included pyridine and the three isomeric hydroxypyridines. 2. Suitable modifications of the cultural conditions led to the accumulation of pyridinediols (dihydroxypyridines), which were isolated and characterized. 3. Three species of Achromobacter produced pyridine-2,5-diol from 2- or 3-hydroxypyridine whereas an uncommon Agrobacterium sp. (N.C.I.B. 10413) produced pyridine-3,4-diol from 4-hydroxypyridine. 4. On the basis of chemical isolation, induction of the necessary enzymes in washed suspensions and the substrate specificity exhibited by the isolated bacteria, the initial transformations proposed are: 2-hydroxypyridine --> pyridine-2,5-diol; 3-hydroxypyridine --> pyridine-2,5-diol and 4-hydroxypyridine --> pyridine-3,4-diol. 5. A selected pyridine-utilizer, Nocardia Z1, did not produce any detectable hydroxy derivative from pyridine, but carried out a slow oxidation of 3-hydroxypyridine to pyridine-2,3-diol and pyridine-3,4-diol.

Formate, but not the alternative likely product formamide, was further oxidized fivefold faster by 4-hydroxypyridine-grown washed cells than by similar organisms grown on succinate. 3. The oxidation of pyridine-3,4-diol by crude extracts at pH8.5 required 1mol of O(2)/mol of substrate, produced 1mol of acid and led to the formation of formate and a new compound with an extinction maximum of 285nm (Compound I). This step was believed to be mediated by a new labile dioxygenase (t((1/2))=4h at pH7.0, 4 degrees C) cleaving the pyridine ring between C-2 and C-3. 4. Many of the properties of this pyridine-3,4-diol dioxygenase paralleled those of the extradiol (;meta') oxygenases of aromatic-ring cleavage. The extreme lability of the enzyme has so far precluded extensive purification. 5. Compound I showed changes in the u.v.-absorption spectrum with pH but after acidification it was converted into a new product, 3-formylpyruvate, with an extinction maximum now at 279nm. 6. Both Compound I and 3-formylpyruvate were metabolized by extracts but at very different rates. The slower rate of metabolism of Compound I was nevertheless consistent with that of pyridine-3,4-diol metabolism. 7. On acidification Compound I released about 0.65mol of NH(3) and has been identified as 3-formiminopyruvate. 8. 3-Formylpyruvate was hydrolysed to formate and pyruvate (K(m) 2mum) by an acylpyruvate hydrolase active against several other dioxo homologues.

Acenaphthene underwent monooxygenation to 1-acenaphthenol with subsequent conversion to 1-acenaphthenone and cis- and trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diols, while acenaphthylene was dioxygenated to give cis-acenaphthene-1,2-diol. Nonspecific dehydrogenase activities present in the host strain led to the conversion of both of the acenaphthene-1,2-diols to 1,2-acenaphthoquinone. The latter was oxidized spontaneously to naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid. No aromatic ring dioxygenation products were detected from acenaphthene and acenaphthylene. Mixed monooxygenase and dioxygenase actions of naphthalene dioxygenase on fluorene yielded products of benzylic 9-monooxygenation, aromatic ring dioxygenation, or both. The action of naphthalene dioxygenase on a variety of methyl-substituted aromatic compounds, including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and isomers of dimethylnaphthalene, resulted in the formation of benzylic alcohols, i.e., methyl group monooxygenation products, which were subsequently converted to the corresponding carboxylic acids by dehydrogenase(s) in the host strain.

In three of the four mini-Tn5 inserted mutants, the mini-Tn5s were inserted into the same locus (within about 16 kb) as the arhA1A2 genes, which had previously been identified as the genes encoding the terminal oxygenase components for the initial oxygenation of acenaphthene. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the corresponding 16.4 kb DNA fragment revealed the existence of 16 ORFs and a partial ORF. From these ORFs, the genes encoding the ferredoxin (ArhA3) and ferredoxin reductase (ArhA4) complementary to ArhA1A2 were identified. RT-PCR analysis suggested that a 13.5 kb gene cluster, consisting of 13 ORFs and including all the arhA genes, forms an operon, although it includes several ORFs that are apparently unnecessary for acenaphthene degradation. Furthermore, using gene disruption and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, the LysR-type activator, ArhR, required for expression of the 13.5 kb gene cluster was also identified. Transcription of the gene cluster by ArhR was induced in the presence of acenaphthene (or its metabolite), and a putative binding site (T-N11-A motif) for ArhR was found upstream from the transcription start point of arhA3.",10.1099/mic.0.28825-0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1099/mic.0.28825-0,Acenaphthylene

Resting cells incubated with acetylene formed a product identified as acetaldehyde, but attempts to demonstrate acetylene hydrase activity in cell-free extracts were unsuccessful. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in N. rhodochrous was found to be NAD+ linked and nonacylating, converting acetaldehyde to acetate. Specific activities of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetothiokinase, and isocitrate lyase were enhanced in cells grown on acetylene and ethanol as compared with cells grown on alternate substrates. These results suggest that acetylene is catabolized via acetaldehyde to acetate and eventually to acetyl coenzyme A. Acetylene oxidation in N. rhodochrous appears to be constitutive and is not inhibited in the presence of either ethylene, nitrous oxide, or methane.",10.1128/jb.150.2.989-992.1982,https://sci-hub.se/10.1128/jb.150.2.989-992.1982,Acetylene
2268290,Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase. Mechanism of acetylene reduction and its inhibition by carbon monoxide.,The Biochemical journal,"Lowe DJ, Fisher K, Thorneley RN","The electron flux through the MoFe-protein of nitrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae determines the absolute and relative rates of 2H+ reduction to H2 and acetylene (C2H2) reduction to ethylene (C2H4) at saturating levels of reductant (Na2S2O4) and MgATP. High electron flux, induced by a high Fe-protein (Kp2)/MoFe protein (Kp1) ratio, favours C2H2 reduction. These data can be explained if ethylene, the two-electron reduction product of C2H2, is not released until three electrons have been transferred from Kp2 to Kp1. This explanation is also consistent with a pre-steady-state lag phase for C2H4 formation of 250 ms observed when functioning enzyme is quenched with acid. Electron flux through nitrogenase is inhibited by C2H2 at high protein concentrations. This is because the association rate between Kp1 and oxidized Kp2 is enhanced by C2H2, leading to an increased steady-state concentration of the inhibitory complex Kp2oxKp1C2H2. This effect is not relieved by CO. Thus CO and C2H2 (or C2H4) must be bound at the same time to distinct sites, presumably at Mo or Fe centres, on the enzyme.",10.1042/bj2720621,https://sci-hub.se/10.1042/bj2720621,Acetylene

The specific enzyme activity in cell extract was highest after growth in the presence of tungstate. Enzyme activity was stable even after prolonged storage of the cell extract or of the purified protein under air. However, enzyme activity could be measured only in the presence of a strong reducing agent such as titanium(III) citrate or dithionite.

The data allowed the design of oligonucleotide probes which were used to clone a nitrilase encoding gene. Plasmid pNK21, in which 2.05-kb sequence covering the region encoding the nitrilase was was placed under the control of the lac promoter, directed overproduction of enzymatically active nitrilase in response to addition of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside in Escherichia coli. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cell extract showed that the amount of nitrilase was about 40% of the total soluble proteins, leading to the establishment of a simple purification of the nitrilase. The nucleotide sequence of the nitrilase gene predicts a protein composed of 383 amino acids (M(r) = 42,275), including only one cysteine. The amino acid sequence homology between the Rhodococcus nitrilase and the Klebsiella ozaenae bromoxynil nitrilase [Stalker et al. (1988) J. Biol.

This conjugation is mediated by glutathione-S-transferase, which is present in microorganisms, plants, and mammals. Other organic sulfides and inorganic sulfide also react through a nucleophilic attack on the 2-chloro group of acetanilide herbicides, but the products are only partially characterized. Sorption in soils and sediments is an important factor controlling the migration and bioavailability of these herbicides, while microbial degradation is the most important factor in determining their overall fate in the environment. The biodegradation of alachlor and metolachlor is proposed to be only partial and primarily cometabolic, and the ring cleavage seems to be slow or insignificant. Propachlor biodegradation has been reported to proceed to substantial (> 50%) mineralization of the ring structure. Reductive dechlorination may be one of the initial breakdown mechanisms under anaerobic conditions. Aerobic and anaerobic transformation products vary in their polarity and therefore in soil binding coefficient.

Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters. Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions. Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge. Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry. Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data. Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments. Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan. A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides.

In this study, we report the cloning and partial characterization of a gene region from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP that encodes atrazine degradation activity. A 22-kb EcoRI genomic DNA fragment, designated pMD1, was shown to encode atrazine dechlorination activity in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Atrazine degradation was demonstrated by a zone-clearing assay on agar medium containing crystalline atrazine and by chromatographic methods. A gene conferring the atrazine-clearing phenotype was subsequently subcloned as a 1.9-kb AvaI fragment in pACYC184, designated pMD4, and was expressed in E. coli. This result and random Tn5 mutagenesis established that the 1.9-kb AvaI fragment was essential for atrazine dechlorination. High-pressure liquid and thin-layer chromatographic analyses were used to rigorously establish that E. coli containing pMD4 degraded atrazine and accumulated hydroxyatrazine. Hydroxyatrazine was detected only transiently in E. coli containing pMD1. This is consistent with the idea that hydroxyatrazine is the first metabolite in atrazine degradation by Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP.

In this study, we show that this fragment also contained the second gene of the atrazine metabolic pathway, atzB. AtzB catalyzed the transformation of hydroxyatrazine to N-isopropylammelide. The product was identified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometery, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tn5 mutagenesis of pMD1 was used to determine that atzB was located 8 kb downstream of atzA. Hydroxyatrazine degradation activity was localized to a 4.0-kb ClaI fragment, which was subcloned into the vector pACYC184 to produce plasmid pATZB-2. The DNA sequence of this region was determined and found to contain two large overlapping divergent open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 was identified as the coding region of atzB by demonstrating that (i) only ORF1 was transcribed in Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, (ii) a Tn5 insertion in ORF2 did not disrupt function, and (iii) codon usage was consistent with ORF1 being translated. AtzB had 25% amino acid identity with TrzA, a protein that catalyzes a hydrolytic deamination of the s-triazine substrate melamine.

The first enzyme, AtzA, catalyzes the hydrolytic dechlorination of atrazine, yielding hydroxyatrazine. The second enzyme, AtzB, catalyzes hydroxyatrazine deamidation, yielding N-isopropylammelide. In this study, the third gene in the atrazine catabolic pathway, atzC, was cloned from a Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP cosmid library as a 25-kb EcoRI DNA fragment in Escherichia coli. The atzC gene was further delimited by functional analysis following transposon Tn5 mutagenesis and subcloned as a 2.0-kb EcoRI-AvaI fragment. An E. coli strain containing this DNA fragment expressed N-isopropylammelide isopropylamino hydrolase activity, metabolizing N-isopropylammelide stoichiometrically to cyanuric acid and N-isopropylamine. The 2.0-kb DNA fragment was sequenced and found to contain a single open reading frame of 1,209 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 403 amino acids. AtzC showed modest sequence identity of 29 and 25%, respectively, to cytosine deaminase and dihydroorotase, both members of an amidohydrolase protein superfamily. The sequence of AtzC was compared to that of E. coli cytosine deaminase in the regions containing the five ligands to the catalytically important metal for the protein. Pairwise comparison of the 35 amino acids showed 61% sequence identity and 85% sequence similarity. AtzC is thus assigned to the amidohydrolase protein family that includes cytosine deaminase, urease, adenine deaminase, and phosphotriester hydrolase. Similar sequence comparisons of the most highly conserved regions indicated that the AtzA and AtzB proteins also belong to the same amidohydrolase family.

Ammonia was detected as a product of nitrogen elimination. 6-Hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione was oxidized to cyclohepta-1,3,5-trione by an induced NAD(sup+)-specific dehydrogenase.

Pure cultures.,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,"Fuchs A, de Vries FW","With different soil and water samples as inoculum and the benzimidazole fungicides benomyl (either as Benlate or as the pure compound) and thiabendazole as selective agents, a large number of, mainly fluorescent, Pseudomonas strains were isolated which nearly all were able to grow in a mineral medium with benomyl as the sole source of carbon. However, no growth occurred with any of a series of other benzimidazole compounds, viz. benzimidazole, 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB), thiabendazole and fuberidazole. Although benomyl--or rather its non-enzymatic breakdown product methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate (MBC)--was partially degraded to 2-AB, most probably n-butylamine, which arises after splitting off of the butylcarbamoyl side chain, was the actual carbon source for the Pseudomonas isolates. When incorporated in a lactate medium, 2-AB markedly inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas spp. at a concentration of 250 microgram/ml, with complete inhibition being attained at 500 microgram/ml. For Bacillus spp. grown in liquid peptone media benzimidazole compounds were inhibitory at concentrations of 500-1000 microgram/ml, with a toxicity increasing in the order: benzimidazole less than thiabendazole less than MBC less than 2-AB.",10.1007/BF00394306,https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/BF00394306,Benomyl

CBW capable of degrading carbendazim.,Biodegradation,"Fang H, Wang Y, Gao C, Yan H, Dong B, Yu Y","With the intensive application of carbendazim in greenhouse production of vegetables and the production of medicinal herbs, there is an increasing need to find a way to remediate carbendazim-contaminated soil. A bacterial stain capable of utilizing carbendazim as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from soil. The isolate was designated CBW and identified as a member of Pseudomonas sp. based on its colony morphology, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Biolog analysis. About 87.1 and 99.1% of carbendazim at concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0 mg l(-1) in mineral salts medium were removed by the isolate CBW after incubation for 3 days, respectively. The optimal pH value for the isolate CBW to degrade carbendazim was 7.0. The degradation rate of carbendazim by the isolate CBW was found to increase slightly with temperature. According to the metabolites detected and identified in the present study, it was proposed that carbendazim was first converted to 2-aminobenzimidazole, which was then transformed to 2-hydroxybenzimidazole, 1,2-diaminobenzene, catechol, and finally to carbon dioxide. The results indicate that the isolate CBW is a new bacterial resource for biodegrading carbendazim and might be used for bioremediation of sites heavily contaminated by carbendazim and its derivatives.",10.1007/s10532-010-9353-0,https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10532-010-9353-0,Benomyl

The bacterium was isolated from an abandoned coal gasification site soil by analog enrichment techniques and found to mineralize [14C]PYR. Further degradation studies with PYR showed three metabolites formed by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135, including 4,5-phenanthrene-dicarboxylic acid not previously isolated, 4-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid, and 4,5-pyrene-dihydrodiol. At least two dihydrodiols, 5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol and 10,11-BAA-dihydrodiol, were confirmed by high-resolution mass spectral and fluorescence analyses as products of the biodegradation of BAA by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135. Additionally, a cleavage product of BAA was also isolated. Mass spectra and fluorescence data support two different routes for the degradation of BaP by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135. The 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol and three cleavage products of BaP, including 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid and a dihydro-pyrene-carboxylic acid metabolite, have been isolated and identified as degradation products formed by Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135. These latter results represent the first example of the isolation of BaP ring fission products formed by a bacterial isolate. We propose that while this bacterium appears to attack only one site of the PYR molecule, it is capable of degrading different sites of the BAA and BaP molecules, and although the sites of attack may be different, the ability of this bacterium to degrade these PAH is well supported. The proposed pathways for biodegradation of these compounds by this Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 support the dioxygenase enzymatic processes reported previously for other bacteria.

This organism initially oxidized benzo[a]pyrene with dioxygenases and monooxygenases at C-4,5, C-9,10, and C-11,12. The metabolites were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by UV-visible, mass, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism spectral analyses. The major intermediates of benzo[a]pyrene metabolism that had accumulated in the culture media after 96 h of incubation were cis-4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (benzo[a]pyrene cis-4,5-dihydrodiol), cis-11,12-dihydro-11,12-dihydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (benzo[a]pyrene cis-11,12-dihydrodiol), trans-11,12-dihydro-11,12-dihydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (benzo[a]pyrene trans-11,12-dihydrodiol), 10-oxabenzo[def]chrysen-9-one, and hydroxymethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives of benzo[a]pyrene. The ortho-ring fission products 4-formylchrysene-5-carboxylic acid and 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid and a monocarboxylated chrysene product were formed when replacement culture experiments were conducted with benzo[a]pyrene cis-4,5-dihydrodiol. Chiral stationary-phase HPLC analysis of the dihydrodiols indicated that benzo[a]pyrene cis-4,5-dihydrodiol had 30% 4S,5R and 70% 4R,5S absolute stereochemistry. Benzo[a]pyrene cis-11,12-dihydrodiol adopted an 11S,12R conformation with 100% optical purity. The enantiomeric composition of benzo[a]pyrene trans-11,12-dihydrodiol was an equal mixture of 11S,12S and 11R,12R molecules. The results of this study, in conjunction with those of previously reported studies, extend the pathways proposed for the bacterial metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene.

A mutant, strain B8/36, oxidized biphenyl to cis-(2S,3R)-dihydroxy-l-phenylcyclohexa-4,6-diene (cis-biphenyl dihydrodiol). Strain B8/36 oxidized anthracene, phenanthrene, benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene to cis-dihydrodiols. Other substrates oxidized to cis-dihydrodiols were dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene and dibenzo-p-dioxin. Biphenyl dioxygenase activity was observed in cells of Beijerinckia B1 and B8/36 after growth in the presence of biphenyl, m-, p-xylene and salicylate. Recent studies have led to the reclassification of Beijerinckia B1 as Sphingomonas yanoikuyae strain B1. Subsequent biotransformation studies showed that S. yanoikuyae B8/36 oxidized chrysene to a bis-cis-diol with hydroxyl substituents at the 3,4- and 9,10-positions. Dihydronaphthalene was oxidized to cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, naphthalene, cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene and 2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene. Anisole and phenetole were oxidized to phenol. Thus the S. yanoikuyae biphenyl dioxygenase catalyzes cis-dihydroxylation, benzylic monohydroxylation, desaturation and dealkylation reactions. To date, the genes encoding biphenyl dioxygenase have not been cloned. However, the nucleotide sequence of a S. yanoikuyaeB1 DNA fragment contains five different alpha subunits as determined by conserved amino acids coordinating iron in a Rieske [2Fe-2S] center and mononuclear iron at the catalytic site. The specific role of the different putative oxygenases in biotransformation reactions catalyzed by S. yanoikuyae is not known and presents an exciting challenge for future studies.",10.1038/sj.jim.2900715,https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/sj.jim.2900715,Benzo[a]pyrene

Initially, growth occurred in the form of a biofilm at the interface between the aqueous and non-aqueous liquid phases. However, after a certain time, a transition occurred in the enrichment cultures, with growth occurring in suspension and a concomitant increase in the rate of chrysene degradation. The strain responsible for chrysene degradation in these cultures, named Sphingomonas sp. CHY-1, was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as a novel sphingomonad, the closest relative in the databases being Sphingomonas xenophaga BN6T (96% sequence identity). Both these strains clustered with members of the genera Sphingobium and Rhizomonas, but could not be categorically assigned to either genus. Sphingomonas sp. CHY-1 was characterized in terms of its growth on chrysene and other PAH, and the kinetics of chrysene degradation and 14C-chrysene mineralization were measured. At an initial chrysene concentration of 0.5 g l(-1) silicone oil, and an organic/aqueous phase ratio of 1:4, chrysene was 50% degraded after 5 days incubation and 97.5% degraded after 35 days. The protein content of cultures reached a maximum value of 11.5 microg ml(-1) aqueous phase, corresponding to 92 mg g(-1) chrysene. 14C-labelled chrysene was 50% mineralized after 6-8 weeks incubation, 10.7% of the radioactivity was incorporated into cell biomass and 8.4% was found in the aqueous culture supernatant.

In the case of the common intermediate benzoate, the ring cleavage substrates are either catechol (in bacteria) or 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate, mainly in fungi). We have shown before that many bacteria, e.g. Azoarcus evansii, the organism studied here, use a completely different mechanism. This elaborate pathway requires formation of benzoyl-CoA, followed by an oxygenase reaction and a nonoxygenolytic ring cleavage. Benzoyl-CoA transformation is catalyzed by the iron-containing benzoyl-CoA oxygenase (BoxB) in conjunction with an FAD and iron-sulfur centers containing reductase (BoxA), which donates electrons from NADPH. Here we show that benzoyl-CoA oxygenase actually does not form the 2,3-dihydrodiol of benzoyl-CoA, as formerly postulated, but the 2,3-epoxide. An enoyl-CoA hydratase (BoxC) uses two molecules of water to first hydrolytically open the ring of 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA, which may proceed via its tautomeric seven-membered oxepin ring form. Then ring C2 is hydrolyzed off as formic acid, yielding 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde. The semialdehyde is oxidized by a NADP(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (BoxD) to 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA. Final products of the pathway are formic acid, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA. This overlooked pathway occurs in 4-5% of all bacteria whose genomes have been sequenced and represents an elegant strategy to cope with the high resonance energy of aromatic substrates by forming a nonaromatic epoxide.",10.1074/jbc.M110.124156,https://sci-hub.se/10.1074/jbc.M110.124156,Benzoate
