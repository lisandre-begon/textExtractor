TEXT: Biodegradation of WSPs, such as PLL and PAsA, was observed under aerobic conditions using activated sludge as inoculum, reaching 80% DOC removal after 28 days. ANNOTATION: { "substrates": [ "poly(lysine)", "poly(aspartic acid)" ], "agent": "activated sludge", "transformation": "biodegradation", "conditions": { "environment": "aerobic", "duration": "28 days" }, "result": "80% DOC removal" } ======================================== TEXT: Under OECD 301F conditions, the DOC removal for PAsA reached 83 ± 5% after 28 days with municipal activated sludge. ANNOTATION: { "substrate": "poly(aspartic acid)", "agent": "municipal activated sludge", "conditions": { "test_method": "OECD 301F", "duration": "28 days" }, "result": "83 \u00b1 5% DOC removal" } ======================================== TEXT: The aerobic biodegradation of PAsA was also confirmed by 13C-NMR and GC–MS analysis, indicating mineralization. ANNOTATION: { "substrate": "poly(aspartic acid)", "transformation": "biodegradation", "conditions": { "environment": "aerobic" }, "result": "mineralization confirmed by 13C-NMR and GC\u2013MS" } ======================================== TEXT: No significant DOC removal was observed for CMC or PAA under the same conditions, suggesting limited biodegradability. ANNOTATION: { "substrates": [ "CMC", "poly(acrylic acid)" ], "result": "No significant DOC removal", "interpretation": "limited biodegradability" } ======================================== TEXT: Anaerobic degradation of PAsA was minimal, with less than 10% DOC removal after 60 days using digested sludge. ANNOTATION: { "substrate": "poly(aspartic acid)", "transformation": "anaerobic degradation", "agent": "digested sludge", "conditions": { "environment": "anaerobic", "duration": "60 days" }, "result": "less than 10% DOC removal" } ========================================
