    "name": "(+)-Camphor",
    "description": "Camphor exists in two enantiomers, but the (+)-isomer is more widely distributed. The bicyclic monoterpene ketone (+)-camphor is one of the major components in the leaves of common sage. Camphor and other terpenoid compounds do not accumulate in the environment due to their ready metabolism by many soil bacteria. The best studied reactions of this type are the early steps of the (+)-camphor degradation pathway which require the cytochrome P-450cam hydroxylase operon (camDCAB) on the CAM plasmid of Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453. Reactions for the partial oxidation of (+)-camphor have been shown to proceed by an initial hydroxylation at carbon 5, followed by dehydrogenation to form 2,5-diketocamphane. Subsequent ring oxidation by a 1,2-monooxygenase, results in the formation of a 5-oxo-1,2-campholide ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8515237|Jones et al., 1993]). This 5-oxo-1,2-campholide may be unstable and undergo spontaneous cleavage to form 2-oxo-delta3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetate. The synthesis of 2-oxo-delta3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-CoA was detected when an extract of (+)-camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida was incubated with 2-oxo-delta3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetate, CoA, ATP, and CoA ester synthetase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6848481|Ougham et al., 1983]). The involvement of 2-oxo-delta3-4,5,5-trimethyl-cyclopentenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-monooxygenase was not experimentally established but it is suggested by the accumulation of the delta-lactone of 5-hydroxy-3,4,4-trimethyl-delta2-pimelyate from 2-oxo-delta3 -4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetate. The further metabolism of the ring cleavage remains to be elucidated."

    "description": "1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis-(4`-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), the first of the chlorinated organic insecticides, is a widely distributed and persistent xenobiotic contaminant in the environment. DDT is not metabolized very rapidly by animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. The biological half-life of DDT is about eight years; that is, it takes about eight years for an animal to metabolize half of the amount it assimilates. If ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal over time. Despite being banned in the United States, DDT continues to be widely used in many developing nations. This page shows only its aerobic pathway. The anaerobic degradation of DDT is documented elsewhere in the EAWAG-BBD. The chemical structure of DDT, including aromatic and alicyclic moieties, offers a variety of possibilities for biochemical attack. Several aerobic pathways for DDT metabolism in different organisms were suggested ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9563945|Quensen et al., 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9603826|Hay et al., 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8117093|Nadeau et al., 1994]). Compounds in brackets were not identified but postulated based on other studies, such as those of the Biphenyl Pathway. The steps labeled A, B, C, D, E are mutiple steps whose intermediates are not identified yet. All descriptions as follows were proposed based on other similar experiments. In A, DDE is attacked by a dioxygenase at the ortho and meta positions. Such an attack would give rise to a 2,3-dihydrodiol-DDE intermediate. In B and D, 2-(4`-Chlorophenyl)-3,3-dichloropropenoate may proceed via decarboxylation to yield 1,1-dichloro-(4`-chlorophenyl)ethane. The latter will undergo oxidation of the aliphatic side chain to yield 1,1-dichloro-(4`-chlorophenyl)ethanol which is further oxidized to yield 4-Chloroacetophenone. The terminal methyl group of 1,1-dichloro-(4`-chlorophenyl)ethane may also undergo oxidation to yield phenylacetic acid. In C, the transformation of 4-Chloroacetophenone to 4-Chlorobenzaldehyde may be via complete oxidation and subsequent decarboxylation of the terminal methyl group. In E, the ring-cleavage product would be further degraded to either a C-6- or C-5-chlorinated acid, depending on where the hydrolytic cleavage takes place."

    "description": "1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA) is a synthetic organic solvent widely used in industrial processes and is a major environmental pollutant commonly found in soil, groundwater, and the atmosphere. TCA is present in at least 696 of the 1430 National Priorities List sites identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Because of TCAï¿½s adverse effects on human health, the EPA has set a maximum contaminant level of 200 ppb in drinking water. TCA is also listed as an ozone-depleting substance by the United Nations Environment Programme. Even when released into soil or leached into groundwater, the primary environmental fate of TCA is volatilization to the atmosphere, where it interacts with ozone and contributes to the erosion of the ozone layer. TCA can be reductively dechlorinated under anaerobic conditions to 1,1,-dichloroethane (DCA) by Desulfobacterium autotrophicum (C. Egli, R. Scholtz, A. M. Cook, & T. Leisinger (1987) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 43:257-261.) and a Clostridium sp. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2729985|Galli and McCarty, 1989]). Reductive dechlorination of TCA to DCA and chloroethane (CA) has been documented in methanogenic consortia (J. H. de Best, A. Hage, H. J. Doddema, D. B. Janssen, & W. Harder (1999) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 51:277-283.) and a putative Dehalobacter sp. (designated strain TCA1) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12411705|Sun et al., 2002]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10633545|Chen et al.

The enzymes that catalyze the reductive dehalogenation of TCA have not been identified. TCA can be aerobically transformed to 2,2,2-trichloroethanol by the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b expressing a soluble methane monooxygenase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2624462|Oldenhuis et al., 1989]), and by ethane-utilizing Mycobacterium spp. isolated from soil ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10508110|Yagi et al., 1999]). Further study revealed that one of the Mycobacterium strains produced trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid as minor products (12.7% and 1.2%, respectively, vs. 85.5% of TCA converted to 2,2,2-trichloroethanol) during the aerobic transformation of TCA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11999413|Hashimoto et al., 2002]). Oldenhuis et al (1989) found that M. trichosporium expressing soluble methane monooxygenase completely dechlorinated DCA, but degradation intermediates were not identified.

Its solubility in water is moderate. 1,2,4-TCB has various uses in industry such as a carrier to apply dyes to polyester materials, a heat transfer medium, a degreaser and a lubricant. It also functions as a termite pesticide and an aquatic herbicide. About 93% of 1,2,4-TCB entering the environment through industrial discharges eventually evaporates into atmosphere, about 2.6% and 2.4% leave in terrestrial soil and aquatic sediments respectively, the rest end up in water. 1,2,4-TCB has been found to bioaccumulate in fish tissues. It has high acute toxicity to plants and aquatic life, its chronic toxic effects to aquatic life are also high. The complete microbial mineralization of 1,2,4-TCB as a sole carbon and energy source under aerobic conditions has been observed. The proposed pathway shows that at first 1,2,4-TCB is biodegraded to the corresponding chlorinated catechol by means of dioxygenase and dehydrogenase system, and then channeled into the tricarboxylic acid pathway through ortho cleavage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1987135|van der Meer et al., 1991]). Under anaerobic conditions, some methanogenic microbial consortia are capable of reductively dechlorinating 1,2,4-TCB to chlorobenzene via 1,4-dichlorobenzene (Middeldorp PJM, De Wolf J, Zehnder AJB, Schraa G Applied and Environmental Microbiology (1997) 63: 1225-1229).

    "description": "Halohydrins, including 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (DCP) and 3-chloro-1,2-epoxypropane (epichlorohydrin), are suspected of being carcinogenic, mutagenic and genotoxic. Epichlorohydrin is a synthetic precursor of DCP, which is used as a general solvent, as an intermediate in organic synthesis and in paints, varnishes, lacquers, water colors, binders and photographic lacquers. Two pathways for the degradation of DCP are found in Corynebacterium sp. strain N-1074 which are catalyzed by two groups of two isoenzymes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1447132|Nakamura et al., 1992]). One group of two enzymes, originally designated Ia and IIa, catalyzes the non-stereospecific dechlorination and subsequent hydrolyzation of DCP. Both enzymes accept (R)- and (S)-enantiomers as substrates and convert them to racemic product mixtures ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7765275|Nakamura et al., 1994]). The second group of enzymes, designated Ib and IIb, also accept (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, but convert them to (R)-rich products ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1447132|Nakamura et al., 1992]). Comparisons of protein sequences and immunological properties have shown that halohydrin hydrogen-halide-lyase (HHHL) A (enzyme Ia) is similar, but not identical to HHHL B (enzyme Ib) (Nakamura et al., 1994). Epoxide hydrolase A (enzyme IIa) and epoxide hydrolase B (enzyme IIb) have also been shown to have different structural properties ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1447132|Nakamura et al., 1992]). Although Arthrobacter sp. strain AD2 can dechlorinate DCP and 3-Chloro-1,2-propanediol, it does not possess epoxide hydrolase activity and so cannot use either compound as a sole carbon source. Partial sequence comparisons have shown that the HHHL of strain AD2 is very similar to the Corynebacterium HHHL A (Nagasawa et al., 1992, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 36:478-482). Another species, Agrobacterium radiobacter strain AD1, can use DCP or epichlorohydrin as a sole carbon source. The pathway of degradation is non-enantioselective and similar to that of the Corynebacterium strain. The AD1 epoxide hydrolase has been shown to be very similar to the Corynebacterium epoxide hydrolase A. The HHHL however, is both sequentially and immunologically different from HHHL A and HHHL B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9169427|Rink et al., 1997])."

Handbook Bestrijdingsmiddelen: gebruik & milieu-effecten, p.629-632). Shell D-D and Tolone II also represent an important class of carcinogenic water pollutants.

It is used as moth repellent, general insecticide, pesticide, air deodorant and chemical intermediate for dyes. It is moderately toxic to humans. It is a priority environmental pollutant listed by the Environmental Protection Agency. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene can be degraded under aerobic conditions. Xanthobacter flavus 14pl uses 1,4-dichlorobenzene as the sole source of carbon and energy but does not grow on other (chloro)aromatic compounds. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene is attacked by chlorobenzene dioxygenase, and after rearomatization, the resulting dichlorocatechol is degraded via a modified ortho pathway, as described by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9148781| Sommer & Gorisch (1997)]. Pure cultures of Sphingomonas haloaromaticamans and some Pseudomonas species can degrade 1,4-dichlorobenzene through similar pathways. Under anaerobic conditions, some methanogenic microbial consortia are able to transform 1,4-dichlorobenzene by reductive dechlorination via monochlorobenzene to unsubstituted benzene, as shown in the 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene Pathway."

Furthermore, it is considered a possible human carcinogen, having been shown to be one in rats and guinea pigs. The main routes of human exposure are dermal contact, ingestion, and inhalation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8713712|DeRosa et al., 1996]). Both P. dioxanivorans CB1190 and P. benzenivorans B5 contain putative dioxane monooxygenases induced by 1,4-dioxane or THF. Other strains are capable of cometabolic degradation after growth on THF, propane, and toluene. Based on intermediates identified during degradation, 1,4-dioxane is likely hydroxylated at an ether-bond-associated carbon atom by monooxygenases, resulting in spontaneous oxidizion and ring cleavage to form 2-hydroxyethoxyacetate. A second monooxygenase attack at either the ortho or para position with respect to the carboxylic acid moiety yields a mixture of two dihydroxyethoxyacetates. Spontaneous protonation of the hemiacetal bond results in the progressive formation of various small organic molecules including ethylene gylcol, glyoxylate, glycoaldehyde, oxalate (not shown), and glycolate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18044507|Mahendra et al., 2007]). The fungus Cordyceps sinensis is able to use 1,4-Dioxane as a sole source of carbon. 1,4-Dioxane is converted to two molecules of ethylene glycol via the proposed formation of two hemiacetals at one side of the dioxane molecule by etherase-type reactions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15746326|Nakamiya et al., 2005]). Ethylene glycol is degraded via intermediary metabolism. Extracellular fungal peroxygenases have also been shown to oxidatively cleave a diverse set of low molecular weight ethers including 1,4-dioxane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19713216|Kinne et al., 2009])."

    "description": "This pathway shows the aerobic degradation of 1-Methylnaphthalene by Pseudomonas putida CSV86. 1-Methylnaphthalene is a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon which is found in crude oil and other petroleum products and appears in the environment as a pollutant. The degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like 1-Methylnaphthalene is of great interest because many of these PAHs are known human carcinogens. A soil isolate, Pseudomonas putida CSV86 is able to grow using 1-and 2-Methylnaphthalene as the sole sources of carbon and energy (Mahajan et al., 1994). The organism degrades 1-methylnaphthalene by two pathways: In the first, an aromatic ring hydroxylation pathway, the unsubstituted ring of methylnaphthalene is doubly hydroxylated yielding cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydro-8-methylnaphthalene, which is further oxidized to methyl salicylate and methyl catechol and enters into TCA cycle. In the second, a detoxification pathway, the methyl group is hydroxylated to form 1-hydroxymethylnaphthalene which is further oxidized to 1-naphthoic acid and excreted into the medium as a dead end product as organism P. putida CSV86 failed to grow on 1-naphthoic acid as a sole source of carbon and energy (Mahajan et al., 1994). Other organisms able to degrade 1-Methylnaphthalene include Marinobacter sp. NCE312, Neptunomonas naphthovorans, and the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

It is commonly known as TNT and is an explosive used in military shells, bombs, and grenades, in industrial uses, and in underwater blasting. TNT production in the United State occurs solely at military arsenals. Accidental release of TNT has contaminated groundwater and soil at numerous munition manufacturing sites. The U.S. EPA has listed TNT as a priority pollutant and has recommended its removal from contaminated sites. TNT is toxic to algae and invertebrates and chronic exposure to TNT by humans causes harmful health effects, including anemia and abnormal liver function, cataract development, and skin irritation. The EPA has determined that TNT is a possible human carcinogen, based on animal studies. This page shows only its anaerobic pathway. The aerobic degradation of trinitrotoluene is documented elsewhere in the EAWAG-BBD. Few enzymes have been isolated which catalyze the reactions in these pathways. Indeed, most of the reactions are catalyzed by \"non-specific\" NAD(P)H dependent nitroreductases and are uncharacterized. The last reduction steps to produce triaminotoluene occur only under anaerobic conditions and enzymes which can catalyze these reactions have been found in Desufovibrio sp., Clostridium pasteurianum, and Moorella thermoacetica. Many of these nitro group reductions are also catalyzed by purified xenobiotic reductase enzyme ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10515912|Blehert et al., 1999]). A disulfite reductase capable of catalyzing the final reduction to triaminotoluene has only been found in Desulfovibrio sp. There are very few example of TNT mineralization or transformation to a compound in intermediate metabolism by a pure bacterial culture. Generally mineralization is only detected with bacterial consortia. Many of the products of TNT biodegradation are highly reactive and covalently bind to cellular components and any solid supports (such as soil) present in the culture. The latter prevents or prolongs the mineralization process, but also hinders a further spread of TNT contaminants. Several authors have noted the formation of, as yet, unidentified compounds from TNT biodegradation. These have not been included in either the aerobic or anaerobic pathway maps. Prof R. Crawford and co-workers have also identified an adduct formed from methyl glyoxyl and triaminotoluene, however they suggest this product is not a main stream pathway intermediate, but a product produced by a side reaction related to clostridial fermentation.

    "description": "2,4-Dichloroaniline is a colorless crystalline solid with a characteristic odor. 2,4-Dichloroaniline is used primarily as a dye intermediate, but may also be a found as a biodegradative intermediate of contact type herbicides such as cyclanilide. Humans exposed to 2,4-Dichloroaniline for relatively short periods of time are subject to slight skin and eye irritation, blue skin, blue lips or finger nails, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, confusion, convulsions. Unconsciousness, or abdominal pain. However, humans subjected to prolonged exposure are prone to the formation of methaemoglobin in their blood supply, which effectively reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the bloodstream and could rapidly result in death. The substance is particularly toxic to aquatic organisms, which is due to the impediment of the 2,4-Dichloroaniline on the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood supply, thus effectively suffocating the aquatic organism. 2,4-Dichloroaniline present in soil biodegrades relatively slowly. However, 2,4-Dichloroaniline (2,4-DCA) does not sorb onto soil particles very well and as a result may leach into the groundwater. The first step of the biodegradation of 2,4-DCA is the dechlorination of 2,4-DCA with a reductive dehalogenase that remove chlorine from the ortho position to form a monochlorinated aniline that can be readily degraded ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2604394|Struijs & Rogers, 1989]). The second step is an oxidative deamination of chloroaniline to chlorocatechol via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4051488|Zeyer et al., 1985]). With chlorinated anilines, a meta cleavage pathway forms dead end products or suicide (highly reactive) products. The dead end products are a result of the narrow substrate specificity of the catabolic enzymes of benzoate, phenol or aniline degrading microbes that are ineffective at degrading chlorinated analogs."

It is used in cultivated agriculture and in pasture and rangeland applications, forest management, home and garden situations and for the control of aquatic vegetation. The wide use of this compound has prompted interest in its biodegradation. Alcaligenes eutrophus and other bacteria can degrade 2,4-D through 2,4-dichlorophenol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, and ortho cleavage of this catechol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8226980|Fukumori & Hausinger, 1993]). Alternatively, Axotobacter chroococcum first removes the chloride in the 2 position to produce 4-chlorophenoxyacetate, 4-chlorophenol, and 4-chlorocatechol, again with ortho cleavage of this catechol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2219955|Balajee and Mahadevan, 1993]). 2,4-D biodegradation by this pathway branch may produce a byproduct antibiotic protoanemonin, which can be degraded to cis-acetylacrylate by a dienelactone hydrolase of Pseudomonas sp. strain B13 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9440530|Brueckmann et al., 1998]). Comamonas testosteroni JH5 can cleave 4-chlorocatechol by a meta pathway, forming 5-chloro-2-hydroxymuonate semialdehyde which can be further transformed by a 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase or a 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase. Dehydrogenation is the major route, however the hydrolase step is also of physiological significance. Both branches lead to 5-chloro-2-oxopent-4-eneoate. This does not accumulate, and stoichiometric chloride is quickly released, but the exact route of chloride elimination is not known ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1510672|Hollender et al., 1997]). Pseudomonas cepacia P166 can move the chloride in 5-chloro-2-oxopent-4-eneoate through 5-chloro-4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanate to chloroacetate. Chloroacetate accumulates transiently, and stoichiometric dehalogenation is observed ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7574580|Arensdorf & Focht, 1995])."

Toxicity data for compounds structurally similar to DCTs indicate that it likely exhibits moderate toxicity to aquatic organisms, and will have a moderate potential for bioaccumulation in the environment. 2,4-DCT is hydrophobic, meaning it may be subject to soil and sediment adsorption. 2,4-DCT is also volatile and has been characterized by the EPA as a hazardous air pollutant (HAP). The aerobic pathway for biodegradation of 2,4-DCT is initiated by Ralstonia sp. strain PS12 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12218011|Pollman et al., 2002]). Ring dioxygenation is followed by intradiol cleavage to form 3,5-dichloro-3-methylmuconate. Subsequent degradation involves two different methods for dechlorination. The methylmaleylacetate derivates listed here are the last known intermediates, and are assumed to enter more common intermediary metabolism, but their further metabolism is not well-characterized. Under anaerobic conditions, 2,4-DCT is subject to reductive dehalogenation (loss of chlorine), ultimately entering the anerobic toluene biodegradative pathway."

The manufacture of MBT produces wastewaters with high levels of MBT and its derivatives, and these compounds can also be released into water by factories using MBT and by leaching from MBT-containing products, particularly rubber ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726870|De Wever et al., 1998]). Many other industries also use benzothiazoles, which in some cases degrade to MBT. For example, MBT is a degradation product of a fungicide widely used in the leather and lumber industries, 2-(thiocyanomethylthio)benzothiazole (Reemtsma, Fiehn, Kalnowski, and Jekel (1995) Environ Sci Technol 29:478-485).

Both laboratory and epidemiological studies suggest that MBT acts as a carcinogen in mammals ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15941012|Whittaker et al., 2004]). It also has toxic effects on many bacteria, and its presence inhibits biodegradation of other compounds, including some of its own degradation products ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7765737|De Wever et al., 1994], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11778869|De Wever et al., 2001]). MBT is very resistant to biodegradation, and many of its degradation products are also recalcitrant. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11778869|De Wever et al. (2001)] review many of the biotransformations of MBT and other 2-substituted benzothiazoles (shown on the right below; most of the enzymes are postulated).

MTBT is usually not degraded further, although Reemtsma et al. (1995) report a minor reaction producing 2-(methylsulfinyl)benzothiazole from MTBT, and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6616091|Liu et al. (1983)] describe a culture that can degrade MTBT. De Wever (1995) describes the conversion of MBT to 2,2`-dithio-bis-benzothiazole (DM), benzothiazole-2-sulphonate (BTSO3), a recalcitrant red dye stuff, and recalcitrant polar compounds, as well as the partial mineralization of MBT (De Wever (1995) PhD Thesis, Faculty of Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven). Reemtsma et al. (1995) also report a very minor reaction producing benzothiazole (BT) from MBT. (This reaction is poorly characterized and thus is only balanced provisionally here.) Of these products, DM is resistant to further degradation, although [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8863435|Dufresne et al.

BT is readily degraded, and a Rhodococcus erythropolis strain capable of mineralizing BTSO3 has been isolated ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726870|De Wever et al., 1998]). The degradation pathways for these two metabolites appear to be similar and may share enzymatic machinery. Rhodococcus erythropolis BTSO31 converts both compounds to 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OBT), which is then further hydroxylated to form 2,6-dihydroxybenzothiazole ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726870|De Wever et al., 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11282584|Besse et al., 2001]). While most of these conversions require the presence of oxygen, the conversion of BTSO3 to OBT can also be carried out under anaerobic conditions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726870|De Wever et al., 1998]). A similar pathway for BT degradation has been observed in Rhodococcus rhodochrous OBT18 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726870|De Wever et al., 1998], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11282584|Besse et al., 2001]) and Rhodococcus pyridinovorans PA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12450835|Haroune et al., 2002]). The latter species uses a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase to open the benzene ring. Another pathway for MBT degradation has been described (shown on the left below; enzymes are postulated) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15466583|Haroune et al., 2004]). Rhodococcus rhodochrous OBT18 converts MBT into two metabolites, a cis-dihydrodiol derivative and a hydroxylated form, both of which are then converted to a diacid MBT derivative and further mineralized. Under the laboratory conditions used in this study, this pathway completely mineralized 30 percent of MBT."

A soil isolate, Pseudomonas putida CSV86 is able to grow using 1-and 2-Methylnaphthalene as the sole sources of carbon and energy ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8042906|Mahajan et al., 1994]). In the right-most pathway, the aromatic ring adjacent to the one bearing the methyl moiety is oxidized, resulting in the formation of methylsalicylates and methylcatechols. In the left-most pathway the methyl side chain is hydroxylated and further converted resulting in the formation of naphthoic acid. In addition to this, 2-hydroxymethylnaphthalene formed by the hydroxylation of the methyl group of 2-methylnaphthalene undergoes aromatic ring hydroxylation of the methyl group and the resultant dihydrodiol is further oxidized by a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions to form the end product 4-hydroxymethylcatechol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8042906|Mahajan et al., 1994]). Other organisms able to degrade 2-Methylnaphthalene include Marinobacter sp. NCE312, Vibrio cyclotrophicus, Neptunomonas naphthovorans, Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a, and Mycobacterium sp.

    "name": "3-Fluorobenzoate",
    "description": "3-Fluorobenzoic acid is a fluorinated organic compound. Little attention has been given to the biodegradation of these compounds. The uses of fluorinated aromatic compounds include herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, refrigerants, and anesthetics (B. D. Key, R. D. Howell, & C. S. Criddle (1997) Environ Sci Technol 31:2445-2454). Fluoroorganics are more stable than their chlorine analogues due to the stability of the C-F bond, which is 25 kcal/mol stronger than the C-Cl bond (D. F. McMillen & D. M. Golden (1982) Ann Rev Phys Chem 33:493). Fluoroorganics pose a potential human health concern. Industrial workers exposed to fluroorganics were shown to have higher serum organic fluorine concentrations than individuals not exposed to fluroorganics ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7405826|Ubel et al., 1980]). The health effects of acute fluoride toxicity are well known; however, it is unclear whether fluorinated organic compounds result in the same problems (Akiniwa. K. (1997) Fluoride 30(2): 89-104). In organisms that have been surveyed, metabolism of 2-fluorobenzoate and 4-fluorobenzoate is more common than that of 3-fluorobenzoate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10919805|Song et al., 2000]). Two pathways of 3-fluorobenzoate degradation have been described. In one pathway, degradation is initiated by 1,2-dioxygenation of 3-fluorobenzoate to give 3-fluorohexadiene-cis,cis-1,2-diol-1-carboxylate. This is converted to 3-fluorocatechol, which is slowly metabolized to 2-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate, which is not metabolized further ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16345496|Schreiber et al., 1980]) , leading to accumulation of cytotoxic 3-fluorocatechol. Alternatively, metabolism can begin with 1,6-dioxygenation of 3-fluorobenzoate, which is converted to 5-fluorocyclohexadiene-cis,cis-1,2-diol-1-carboxylate and then sequentially to 4-fluorocatechol, 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate, and eventually oxoadipate, which can enter central metabolism (K. H. Engesser, G. Auling, J. Busse, & H.-J. Knackmuss (1990) Arch Microbiol 153:193-199). Fluoride is also released in this pathway. Both pathways are present in strains that metabolize 3-fluorobenzoate, but metabolic flux through each pathway varies among the organisms (Engesser et al., 1990). Cells of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus NCIB 8250 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1182155|Clarke et al., 1975]) and Pseudomonas sp. B13 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16345496|Schreiber et al., 1980]) grown on benzoate or 3-chlorobenzoate, respectively, metabolized 3-fluorobenzoate, but the strains could not grow on the compound as a carbon and energy source. In these organisms, the major pathway of 3-fluorobenzoate degradation begins with 1,2-dioxygenation. Strain FLB 300 (alpha-2-subclass of Proteobacteria, Agrobacterium-Rhizobium branch) (Engesser et al., 1990) and Sphingomonas sp. HB-1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15321683|Boersma et al., 2004]) were able to grow using 3-fluorobenzoate as a sole carbon and energy source. In these strains that can assimilate 3-fluorobenzoate, the major pathway begins with 1,6-dioxygenation of the substrate, thereby reducing the amount of the toxic 3-fluorocatechol intermediate that is produced."

Formation of reactive nitrogen species is presumed to play a major role in neuron death and the presence of free 3-NTyr is considered a marker for this biochemical event. It has been shown that 3-NTyr exhibits neurotoxicity when injected into rat dopaminergic cells. This neurotoxicity has been linked to the metabolism of 3-NTyr via the concerted action of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase. 3-Nitrotyramine is structurally similar to 3-NTyr, exhibits the same neurotoxic effects and is formed via decarboxylation of 3-NTyr in rat dopaminergic neuronal cells ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16763020|Blanchard-Fillion et al., 2006]). This decarboxylation has not been observed in microbes. 3-Nitrotyramine can be used as a nitrogen source by cultures of Escherichia coli utilizing a periplasmic amine oxidase (TynA) and cytosolic NAD-linked dehydrogenase (FeaB). The biodegradation pathway involves an initial oxidation to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetaldehyde which is further oxidized to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetate (Rankin et al., 2008). These E. coli cultures did not grow on 3-NTyr. The metabolism of 3-NTyr in Variovorax paradoxus JS171 and Burkholderia sp. strain JS165 is carried out by deamination and subsequent decarboxylation to the above mentioned 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetate. Monooxygenase-catalyzed denitration of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetate yields homoprotocatechuate, for which bacterial metabolism is well established ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16461647|Nishino and Spain, 2006])."

    "description": "4-Alkylphenols are amphiphilic compounds commonly used as surfactants in many industrial production processes. They can have many functions, such as surfactants in a detergent or emulsifying agents in plastic or latex production. 4-Nonylphenols, an important class of 4-alkylphenols, have an estimated use of 650,000 tons annually ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11993862|Guenther et al., 2002]). This is a major concern as 4-nonylphenols are not easily degraded and their buildup can be toxic to an array of species from aquatic organisms to mammals ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9699867|Sonnenschein and Soto, 1998]). There can be as many as or more than forty isomers in technical grade 4-nonylphenol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16427065|Moeder et al., 2006]). Microbes have evolved to biodegrade some of the relatively resilient 4-nonylphenol isomers. The process appears to depend on molecular oxygen ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15091914|Ekelund et al., 1993]), suggesting activation of the compound by incorporation of oxygen-bearing functional groups. To better understand 4-nonylphenol catabolism, one particular isomer, 4-(1-ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentylphenol) or NPL, is shown here in detail, with the R stereoisomer as the initial substrate. Both enantiomers are degraded, but not much is currently known regarding stereoselectivity. Sphingomonas spp. carry out the initial biodegradation of NPL. A major and a minor degradation pathway have been postulated, both ultimately leading to hydroquinone and a nonanol that retains the structure of the original nonyl side chain. Sphingomonas spp. can grow on the aromatic part as a carbon and energy source, but are not capable of further catabolizing the nonyl alcohol, and it is discarded as a non-catabolic byproduct ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15665329|Gabriel et al., 2005]). Both the minor and major pathways are catalyzed initially by an ipso-hydroxylation, i.e., hydroxylation at the anchor carbon atom of the alkyl substituent, forming 4-nonyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexadienone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15665329|Gabriel et al., 2005]). 18O-labeling experiments show that the ipso-hydroxy group is derived from molecular oxygen and that the major pathway for cleavage of the alkyl moiety is through cleaving the nonyl chain as alkyl cation (stabilized by the &alpha;-quaternary C atom of the nonyl group) and combination of the cation with a molecule of water to yield the nonyl alcohol and hydroquinone. In the minor pathway (not shown), a 1,2-C,O shift of the alkyl moiety is postulated to yield a 4-alkoxyphenol intermediate. A second ipso-hydroxylation leads to a hemiketal, which then spontaneously decomposes to p-benzoquinone and the nonyl alcohol. p-Quinone is quickly converted to hydroquinone by a reducing system ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17369338|Gabriel et al., 2007])."

PCBs are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulate in food chains and are potentially toxic, prompting efforts to clean up contaminated sites. Bioremediation is being considered as a cheaper, less disruptive and more publicly acceptable alternative to current remediation technologies such as incineration. The EAWAG-BBD also contains the Biphenyl Pathway, which is considered as the degradation model for various PCBs. 4-Chlorobiphenyl is degraded similarly to biphenyl, with 2,3-dioxygenation at the unsubstituted biphenyl ring, followed by rearomatization, and cleavage of this catachol-like ring ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8048958|Fukuda et al., 1994])."

A study dedicated to the isolation and characterization of aromatic compound degrading microbes found 4-fluorobenzoate in freshwater sediment and sewage in concentrations of 50-500 ppm (Horowitz, et al. (1982) Dev Ind Microbiol 23:435-44). Toxicology information is limited for this particular compound but studies on other more common halobenzenes have shown toxicity in high doses. Knowledge of fluorobenzoate metabolism is relatively sparse in comparison to other halobenzoates. Fluorinated organic compounds, such as 4-fluorobenzoate, are more resistant to microbial degradation than other halogenated compounds due to unusual carbon-fluorine bond properties ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12805763|Giesy et al., 2001]). Aerobic metabolism of 4-fluorobenzoate is initiated by an oxygen-dependent ring cleavage in B. cepacia , Pseudomonas sp. B13, A. eutrophus JMP134 and A. eutrophus 335. Cycloisomerization of 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate with the addition of a proton yields 4-fluoromuconolactone as the sole major product. Lactone hydrolysis preceeds a secondary dehalogenation reaction and the resulting product enters intermediary metabolism through the TCA cycle ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2394680|Schlomann et al., 1990]). In contrast to chloride and bromide elimination through a carbanionic intermediate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16345496|Schreiber et al., 1980]), defluorination is not coupled to cycloisomerization and dienelactone formation is negligible ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2394680|Schlomann et al., 1990]). 4-Fluorobenzoate is anaerobically degraded by Aureobacterium sp. strain RHO25. Coenzyme A ligation and dehalogenation yields 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, which enters common intermediary metabolism ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2604392|Oltmanns et al., 1989]). These pathways may be relevant for the degradation of other fluoroaromatic compounds."

Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, the enzyme which can initiate this route of bacterial acenaphthylene metabolism ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16535238|Selifonov et al., 1996]), has many other catalytic abilities, which are documented in a table of Reactions of Naphthalene 1,2-Dioxygenase. 1-Hydroxy-2-ketoacenaphthene is oxidized to acenaphthenequinone, which is oxidatively cleaved to form naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylate.

After growth in media with camphor as sole carbon and energy source, washed cells were capable of transforming adamantanone into number of metabolites. Microbial metabolism of adamantanone (tricyclo[3.3.13,7]decan-2-one) is documented by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1510672| Selifonov (1992).] The potential of such organisms in the biotransformation and production of specialty chemicals however has not yet been fully explored. Hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated adamantane lactones, compounds of potential pharmaceutical and synthetic interest, can be easily obtained using the same biocatalyst, cells of the P.putida, in a \"one pot synthesis\" in essentially quantitative yield. Biotransformation pathways for adamantanone in P.putida strain PpG1 (ATCC 17453) can be proposed as shown in the pathway map. Two divergent reactions of adamantanone oxidation are apparently provided by enzymes responsible for the initial steps of camphor catabolism: camphor 5-monooxygenase(P-450CAM) and camphor 1,2-monooxygenase, a NADH-dependent two-component cycloalkanone monooxygenase, leading to formation of 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one and 4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one, respectively. Cytochrome P-450CAM in cell-free experiments has been shown to catalyze the formation of 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one from adamantanone. However, camphor 1,2-monooxygenase appears to be the first enzyme shown to perform biological Baeyer-Villiger reaction with adamantanone. Further conversion of compounds to hydroxylactone are evidently mediated by camphor 1,2-monooxygenase and camphor 5-monooxygenase both recognizing these adamantane derivatives as substrate analogs of camphor. The hydroxylactone 1-hydroxy-4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one accumulates, although this organism can hydrolyze the camphor lactone."

    "name": "Alachlor",
    "description": "Alachlor is an aniline herbicide used to control annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in field corn, soybeans, and peanuts. It is a selective systemic herbicide, absorbed by germinating shoots and roots. It works by interfering with the plant`s ability to produce protein and elongate roots. When directly applied to soil, it may leach into groundwater and thereby pose a potential health hazard to humans and animals (Sette et al., 2004). Alachlor is degraded by many soil microorganisms, although no pure or mixed cultures able to extensively degrade or mineralize alachlor have been reported. Bacteria and fungi can degrade alachlor through co-metabolism. Sette et al., (2004) used six highly tolerant streptomycete strains in their studies and identified the main biodegradation products as dechlorinated indole compounds, a quinoline derivative compound and a chlorinated indole derivative. Of all the strains reported to degrade alachlor, strain LS182 did not generate the carcinogenic product 2,6-diethylaniline. Hence, LS182 strain may be the best strain to use in bioremediation of alachlor. Reactions A-C, below, all occur spontaneously, in water without microbial inocula. These abiotic reactions are predominently hydrolyses, including dehalogenation and amide hydrolysis, but include more complex reactions as well. The alachlor hydrolase reaction is enzyme-mediated, but also occurs at a slower rate abiotically (Sette et al., 2004). Alachlor can be detoxified by displacement of the chlorine group with a thiol (e.g. glutathione, coenzyme A, cysteine) to produce an alachlor-thiol conjugate. These reactions occur both abiotically and enzymatically via glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Soil microorganisms with GST activity have been shown to product alachlor-cysteine and alachlor-cysteine-glycine conjugates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16534956|Zablotowicz et al., 1995]). Further enzymatic oxidation of these conjugates produce alachlor-ESA (ethyl sulfonic acid) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9561822|Stamper et al., 1998]). Possible metabolites of alachlor-ESA found in soil and groundwater include alachlor-OA (oxanilic acid) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15543734|Postle et al., 2004]) and N-(2,6-Diethylphenyl)-ESA ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12102310|Thurman et al., 2002]).

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12867182|Ma, Zhang, and Wong (2003)] state that anthracene is a priority pollutant because it is carcinogenic, and may cause aberration and mutation in biological tissues. Anthracene biodegradation by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and numerous fungi has been reported (Cerniglia, CE, 1992. Biodegradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Biodegradation, 3: 351-368). This pathway map is limited to bacterial metabolism of anthracene. Pseudomonas spp. strains with plasmids containing genes for naphthalene degradation were found to mineralize anthracene ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8328809|Sanseverino et al., 1993]). Bacteria initiate anthracene degradation by hydroxylation of the aromatic ring to yield cis-1,2-dihydroanthracene-1,2-diol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14342521|Evans et al., 1965]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1239455|Akhtar et al., 1975]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/965633|Jerina et al., 1976]). This intermediate is converted to anthracene-1,2-diol, which is cleaved at the meta position to yield 4-(2-hydroxynaph-3-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14342521|Evans et al., 1965]). This compound may spontaneously rearrange to form 6,7-benzocoumarin or be converted to 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, from which degradation proceeds through 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene to phthalate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10653712|Annweiler et al., 2000]).

Mycobacterium sp. strain LB501T can degrade 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate acid through phthalate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12513994|van Herwijnen et al., 2003]). The Gram-positive bacteria Rhodococcus sp. and Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 (formerly Mycobacterium sp. strain PYR-1) also show ortho cleavage of anthracene-1,2-diol to produce 3-[(Z)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-napthoate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11682202|Dean-Ross et al., 2001]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11282593|Moody et al., 2001]). M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 can produce 1-methoxy-2-hydroxyanthracene from anthracene-1,2-diol, representing a third pathway branch from this intermediate (not shown). In addition to initiating anthracene degradation by 1,2-hydroxylation, M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 can catalyze 9,10-hydroxylation of anthracene to produce anthracene-9,10-dihydrodiol, which is converted to 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene and spontaneously oxidized to 9,10-anthraquinone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11282593|Moody et al., 2001])."

Although anthracene itself is not carcinogenic, its biodegradation and metabolism are of interest because the same type of fused ring structures are found in higher molecular weight PAHs such as benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene, which are carcinogenic. Anthracene and other PAHs are found in crude oil, coal tar and creosote. They are also formed via pyrosynthesis during incomplete combustion. Following fractional distillation of coal tar, the fraction boiling above 270&deg; C is known as \"anthracene oil.\" In addition to anthracene, anthracene oil also contains phenanthrene, fluorene, fluoranthene, pyrene and carbazole. Bacteria can degrade anthracene, as shown elsewhere. Fungi also can degrade anthracene. White rot fungi often prepare aromatic compounds for ring cleavage by first converting them to quinones. The initial oxidation of anthracene (to 9,10-anthraquinone), benzo[a]pyrene (Haemmerli, et al., 1986) and several other PAHs is catalyzed by lignin peroxidases from Phanerochaete chrysporium, Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS55 (Field, J.A. et al., Enzyme and Micro. Tech. 18:300-308, 1996) and other white rot fungi. Manganese peroxidases, another family of lignin degrading peroxidases produced by white rot fungi, can also oxidize anthracene (Eibes et al., 1986). Laccases, copper-containing enzymes that are also involved in lignin degradation by Trametes versicolor, have also been shown to oxidize anthracene (Collins et al., 1986). Not all white rot fungi produce laccases. P. chrysosporium can completely mineralize anthracene. It cleaves 9,10-anthraquinone to phthalate and, here proposed, catechol, though o-benzoquinone or aliphatic compounds are also possible (Hammel et al., 1991). Not all fungi that metabolize anthracene completely mineralize it. Others detoxify anthracene by conjugation followed by secretion. Cunninghamella elegans oxidizes anthracene to anthracene-1,2-oxide using a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9451829|Cerniglia, 1997]). This can be further oxidized to anthracene-trans-1,2-dihydrodiol (Cerniglia and Yang, 1983), or oxidized to 1-anthrol non-enzymatically. 1-Anthrol can form conjugates with xylose, glucuronate and sulfate (Sutherland et al., Myco.

Extensive research has been undertaken on the mechanism and extent of arsenic bioalkylation. However, still not much is known on the environmental fate of organoarsenicals. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7711909|Quinn and McMullan (1995)] found that strain ASV2, a Gram-negative bacterium isolated from activated sludge, can utilize arsonoacetate as sole carbon and energy source. This is the first report of a microorganism capable of utilizing a compound containing the carbon-arsenic bonds. In the cells of ASV2, arsonoacetate is degraded into arsenite and acetate in C-As bond cleavage reaction. Since arsenite is more toxic than arsenate, it is oxidized to arsenate by arsenite oxidase as an effective means of detoxification. By contrast, some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, are able to reduce arsenate to arsenite. This reaction is catalyzed by arsenate reductase, an enzyme encoded in plasmids in those bacterial cells."

    "name": "Asulam",
    "description": "Asulam (methyl N-(4-aminophenyl) sulfonylcarbamate) is a colorless crystalline solid used as a herbicide to control grasses and weeds on sugarcane and non croplands. This herbicide is mainly formulated and applied as asulam sodium salt. Asulam is 0.5% soluble in water while its salt is two hundred times more soluble. The half life of asulam in topsoil is up to 6 weeks ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/428664|Balba et al., 1979]). According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Asulam Fact Sheet) and some scientific evidence ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1452156|Hu et al., 1992]), asulam is considered a low toxic herbicide. Human exposure to asulam is mainly through diet. The Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 180.360) established a tolerance level of 0.1 ppm of asulam in sugarcane, but no additional information is reported for other food products. According to the EPA, asulam and its metabolites cannot exceed 272 ppb in surface water. Aerobic degradation of asulam has been identified in Flavobacterium sp. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/701200|Walker, 1978]), Curtobacterium sp. and Pseudomonas sp. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/428664|Balba et al., 1979]). According to Balba, asulam is first transformed to sulfanilamide and then 4-aminobenzenesulfonate by two hydrolytic reactions. 4-Aminobenzenesulfonate is converted to 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate and subsequent 1,2,4-benzenetriol by two oxidation reactions catalyzed by a monooxygenase and dioxygenase, respectively. 4-Aminobenzenesulfonate is also be converted to 4-Sulfocatechol via a deaminating dioxygenase. Intradiol cleavage of 4-sulfocatechol, lactonization, and subsequent hydrolysis forms maleylacetate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9603860|Blumel et al., 1998])."

Atrazine is the leading member of a class of triazine ring-containing herbicides that includes simazine and terbuthylazine. The Triazine Metapathway Map contains additional information on triazine metabolism. A number of different bacteria have been identified that are capable of metabolizing atrazine to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Atrazine biodegradation has been found to occur via several different pathways that funnel into cyanuric acid metabolism. A gene region from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP encoding atrazine degradation enzymes has been cloned and characterized. The initial hydrolytic dechlorination of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7574646|de Souza et al., 1995]) is an animated reaction. Two enzymes belonging to the amidohydrolase protein family catalyze the sequential removal of ethylamine and isopropylamine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9055410|Boundy-Mills et al., 1997] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9422605|Sadowsky et al., 1998]).

Deethylatrazine undergoes a second oxidative removal of the isopropyl group. Hydrolytic removal of s-triazine ring substituents from deisopropylatrazine and deisopropyldeethylatrazine yields cyanuric acid."

Pseudomonas sp. AT3 can grow on atropine as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. The initial step in the degradation is hydrolysis of the atropine ester bond to form tropine and tropate. Tropine is converted to nortropine, which is degraded through oxidative cleavage of the bridging N-C bonds to 6-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione. This is oxidized to cyclohepta-1,3,5-trione. This latter compound is hydrolytically cleaved to 4,6-dioxoheptanoate, which is hydrolyzed to succinate and acetone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16535398|Bartholomew et al., 1996]).

Carbendazim is quite stable in soil and water, and is a suspected mutagen, carcinogen, and endrocrine disruptor. Thus studies on its biodegradation are of interest ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20228105|Pandey et al., 2010]). Several Pseudomonas species can use benomyl as the sole carbon source for growth. The initial step in the degradation of benomyl is hydrolysis of the butylcarbamoyl side chain to form carbendazim (MBC). The N-butylcarbamate formed is hydrolyzed to n-butylamine. The carbendazim is hydrolyzed to 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB). Only small amounts of these compounds are formed; n-butylamine may be the carbon source for growth ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/582241|Fuchs and DeVries, 1978]). Rhodococcus jialingiae djl-6-2 is capable of using carbendazim as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. It also hydrolyzes it to 2-aminobenzimidazole, which is converted to 2-hydroxybenzimidazole. This last compound is postulated to be dioxygenated, either by a dioxygenase or two consecutive monoxygenase reactions, to 2,6,7-trihydroxybenzimidazole. Extradiol cleavage forms (2Z)-3-(4-formyl-2-hydroxy-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-2-hydroxyprop-2-enoate. Benzimidazole is also produced in a side reaction, possibly by deamination of carbendazim ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833408|Wang et al., 2010]). Pseudomonas sp. CBW is capable of using carbendazim as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth. It follows the above pathway through 2-hydroxybenzimidazole. It can metabolize 2-hydroxybenzimidazole and 1,2-diaminobenzene. It is postulated to cleave the heteroring of 2-hydroxybenzimidazole to produce 1,2-diaminobenzene, which might be converted to catechol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383655|Fang et al., 2010]). Nocardioides sp. SG-4G is capable of using carbendazim, 2-aminobenzimidazole, and 2-hydroxybenzimidazole as sole carbon and energy sources for growth. The pathway followed is the same as for the above two organisms, through 2-hydroxybenzimidazole.

The pathways are initiated by mono- or di-oxygenation at different positions, followed by dehydration of the resulting dihydrodiols, and then oxidative cleavage, usually at the meta-position. Cleavage products are then decarboxylated to form chrysene derivatives. Sphingomonas sp.

It is an excellent solvent of synthetic musks and vanillin, and a fixative in bouguet perfumes. Benzoate is a common intermediate in the anaerobic metabolism of aromatic compounds, documented elsewhere in the UMBBD. Two branches for aerobic benzoate metabolism are dioxygenation to form catechol, found in some bacteria ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1938949|Harayama et al., 1991]), and monooxygenation to form protocatechuate, used mostly by fungi ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4026866|Sahasrabudhe et al., 1985]). Azoarcus evansii and some other bacteria use a third branch, starting with ligation with CoA to form benzoyl-CoA, and its monooxygenation to form the 2,3-epoxy compound. This is followed by hydrolysis of the epoxide, possibly with transient oxepin formation, to form 2,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde, and oxidation of this to 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA. This last compound is metabolized to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA in several uncharacterized steps. This branch occurs in 4.5% of 649 bacteria whose genomes have been sequenced, compared to the 7% that contain the dioxygenase branch ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20452977|Rather et al., 2010]). 2-Chlorobenzoate and saccharin biodegradation is also included on this pathway map. 2-Chlorobenzene is used as a preservative for glues and paints and an intermediate in the manufacture of fungicides, dyes, pharmaceuticals and other organic chemicals. Saccharin, o-Benzosulfimide, is used as a flavoring agent and non-nutritive sweetener."

    "description": "Benzoate (or benzoyl-CoA) is the most common intermediate in anaerobic metabolism of aromatic compounds. In the absence of molecular oxygen, the aromatic ring is first reduced prior to ring cleavage. Benzoate is activated to benzoyl-CoA. Dearomatization of the benzene ring is occurs upon a 2 electron reduction of benzoyl-CoA to cyclohex-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA. For subsequent oxidation of cyclohex-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA, two metabolic routes are currently discussed, one which involves cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA as intermediate and another which involves 6-hydroxy-cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA. For more specific information, see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/97144512|Harwood and Gibson (1998)] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/93170297|Koch et al (1993)].

Activities of cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA hydratase, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 2-ketocyclohexane-1-carboxyl-CoA hydrolase were not demonstrated directly. The left side of the reactions from 6-Hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA to 3-Hydroxypimelyl-CoA is proposed and has not been identified experimentally. The Pimelyl-CoA degradation from Pimelyl-CoA to Acetyl-CoA is also proposed and most of the enzymes of this sequence do not appear to have been directly assayed.

    "name": "Benzothiophene Desulfurization",
    "description": "Organic sulfur compounds found in petroleum lead to the formation of sulfur dioxide during combustion. Sulfur dioxide emissions can poison catalytic converters, cause acid deposition and increase diesel particulate emissions. Polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs), such as benzothiophene, account for a large fraction of this organic sulfur content ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574137|Liang et al., 2006]). Microbial desulfurization processes are of particular interest as a means to reduce the petroleum sulfur content and minimize pollution. Several microorganisms are able to incorporate the sulfur from benzothiophene into cell biomass. This desulfurization process involves sulfur-specific degradation via the cleavage of carbon-sulfur bonds. Benzothiophene is first oxidized to Benzothiophene-S,S-dioxide and subsequent thiophene ring opening via cleavage of the aryl C-S bond in a mechanism similar to dibenzothiophene desulfurization ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782503|Gilbert et al., 1998] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12147483|Kirimura et al., 2002]). The final desulfination step in Gordona sp. strain 213E is thought to occur by oxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation of the C-S carbon. In this case, an enol product is formed but quickly tautomerizes to the aldehyde upon release from the enzyme ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782503|Gilbert et al., 1998]). If this aldehyde is oxidized to the carboxylate, it forms 2-hydroxyphenylacetate, a compound found in the styrene pathway. The desulfination product in Paenibacillus sp. strain A11-2 is o-hydroxystyrene via a sulfinase also capable of dibenzothiophene desulfination ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12743754|Konishi et al., 2003]). Dibenzothiophene has both a desulfurization pathway and a pathway for complete metabolism of the compound. The latter pathway may also occur for benzothiophene."

Bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, also known as Yperite or mustard gas, is the most produced and stored chemical weapon. It is highly cytotoxic and is a carcinogenic and mutagenic alkylating agent; benzyl sulfide has been used as a non-toxic model for its metabolism. The microbial degradation of benzyl sulfide can be carried out by white-rot (Coriolous versicolor) and brown-rot (Tyromyces palustris) fungi ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9256235|Itoh et al., 1997]). The initial step may be the oxidative cleavage of the C-S bond to yield benzaldehyde and benzyl mercaptan. Benzaldyde can be reduced to benzyl alcohol or oxidized to benzoate. Benzyl mercaptan can be converted to benzyl disulfide in the presense or absence of fungi. Degradation of the disulfide to the mercaptan was observed in the presence of fungi. Benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and benzoate follow the toluene pathway and are finally mineralized to CO2 and H2O. These and several other fungi can also oxide benzyl sulfide to the sulfoxide and the sulfone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571066|Van Hamme et al., 2003]), and this may be the primary aerobic route. The first oxidation step is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes such as laccase, but the second step is cytochrome P450 (unspecific monooxygenase) mediated. Rhodococcus sp. strain IGTS8 can perform these same two oxidations using a single sulfide/sulfoxide monooxygenase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8824615|Lei and Tu, 1996])."

Pseudomonia sp. strain LB 400 is particularly noteworthy. It encodes four enzymes and catabolizes biphenyl to benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate through four steps, often called the biphenyl upper pathway. Interestingly, after growth with biphenyl, many bacteria can oxidize polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of man-made compounds composed of biphenyl molecules containing from 1 to 10 chlorines, and persistent and toxic in biophere. It has been shown that PCBs follow the same catabolic pathway as biphenyl and use the same enzymes. Biphenyl dioxygenase plays a critical role in PCB degradation by catalyzing the first step. Its activity varies depending on the number of chlorines and their positions on the aromatic ring. The EAWAG-BBD also contains the biodegradation pathway for one model PCB, 4-chlorobiphenyl. This pathway is a description of the upper pathway for metabolism of biphenyl as encoded by the bph locus of Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400 as described by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/95344182|Seeger, et al.

More information on this compound can be found at the Bisphenol A website from the Bisphenol A Global Industry Group and the Bisphenol A page at the Hormone Disrupting Compounds site. Bisphenol A is metabolized by a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium (strain MV1) via a novel pathway involving oxidative skeletal rearrangement. The metabolism involves two primary pathways: a minor pathway, in which Bisphenol A is first oxidized to a triol, and a major pathway, in which Bisphenol A is metabolized to form the intermediates 4-hydroxybenzoate and 4-hydroxyacetophenone that are converted to carbon dioxide and biomass ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8125948|Spivack et al., 1994]). Sphingobium xenophagium Bayram and Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP3 can metabolize bisphenol A by an ipso-substitution mechanism that involves ring hydroxylation at the site of the substituent. This proposed hydroxylation product can be cleaved to form hydroquinone and a proposed 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropyl cation. The cation can be transformed to 4-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenol, which can eliminate water to form 4-isopropenylphenol. 4-Isopropenylphenol can be reduced to 4-isopropylphenol. These are the reactions found in both organisms. There are other possible routes (not shown here), including formation of a 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-isopropyl anion instead of the cation, to the above products, and other side reactions occur in one organism or the other ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17886831|Gabriel et al., 2007], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17557840|Kolvenbach et al., 2007]).

Methanogens are strictly anaerobic and produce methane in environments such as sediments, rice paddies and the guts of ruminant organisms. In some environments, such as lakes, it has been observed that 90% of biogenic methane is oxidized before reaching the atmosphere. Methane is biologically oxidized in aerobic environments, such as the upper regions of lakes, by a series of 2-electron oxidation reactions known collectively as methanotrophic metabolism, or methanotrophy. The environmental coupling of methanogenesis and methanotrophy leads to a high turnover global cycle of C1 compounds.

There are multiple possible pathways depending on the genus, species and strain of organism degrading the caffeine. In the bacteria Psuedomonas putida and Serratia marcescens, the major pathway is through theobromine to 7-methylxanthine to xanthine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14977550|Mazzafera, 2004]). Minor branches produce methyluric acids; it has been proposed that these degrade to uric acid ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17009088|Dash and Gummadi, 2006]), but this has not been confirmed. Another bacterial pathway, found in Rhodococcus and Klebsiella spp., requires oxidation to yield 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9705852|Madyastha and Sridhar, 1998]). Caffeine can also be degraded via alternative pathways found in several fungal and one bacterial species."

    "description": "Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is found naturally in coffee, tea and cocoa and used as a food and drug additive. When ingested by humans, caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, elevates blood pressure, increases metabolic rate, and acts as a diuretic ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16507475|Higdon and Frei, 2006]). Caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of Parkinson`s disease. However, adverse reactions to caffeine consumption can include anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations, abdominal pain, and nausea, and high caffeine intake has been linked with increased risk of osteoporosis and complications in pregnancy ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17009088|Dash and Gummadi, 2006]). Caffeine is also mildly addictive. Withdrawal symptoms can include headache, fatigue, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, nausea, and muscle pain ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16507475|Higdon and Frei, 2006]). Coffee pulp, a waste product produced during coffee processing, is a major pollutant in water bodies near coffee plants. Even though it is high in nutrients, it cannot be used as animal feed due to the high levels of caffeine and other unwanted compounds ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10959086|Pandey et al., 2000]). Solvents commonly used to produce caffeine-free products are either very expensive to use or toxic ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17009088|Dash and Gummadi, 2006]). However, a number of bacterial and fungal strains capable of degrading caffeine have been identified ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14977550|Mazzafera, 2004]). The pathway described below has been documented for members of the fungal species Penicillium commune and Aspergillus tamarii (Hakil et al. 1998. Enzyme Microb Technol 22: 355-359), other members of these two genera, and the bacterial species Pseudomonas putida CBB5 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19447909|Yu et al., 2009]). In the major fungal pathway, caffeine degrades via theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) and 3-methylxanthine to xanthine. Bacterial and minor fungal pathway branches funnel through paraxanthine and theobromine. In contrast to other known bacterial pathways, no methyluric acids are reported as degradation products."

It is a precursor in the synthesis of Nylon-6 and as such, among the most highly used chemical intermediates in manufacturing worldwide. More than 9.5 billion pounds of Caprolactam is produced each year with a market value exceeding 4.5 billion dollars. The manufacture and use of Caprolactam in such large quantities makes environmental contamination inevitable. This is of concern, because it is known to have some toxic affects. Prolonged, heavy exposure in humans can lead to dermatitis, fever and seizures. In several tests, Caprolactam had a mutagenic affect, introducing DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations. In some studies it has been observed that strains of Pseudomonas sp. capable of degrading Caprolactam could be isolated from enriched sources. In 36.8% of these strains the degradative capability was linked to plasmids contained therein [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2263224|(Esikova et al., 1990)]. In recent reports, strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa capable of utilizing Caprolactam as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen were readily isolated following enrichment of pond water, or activated sludge ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7487018|Steffensen and Alexander, 1995]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9688819|Kulkarni and Kanekar, 1998]).

It has a high mammalian toxicity due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The oral LD50 value of carbofuran in mice and other animals has been reported to vary from 2 to 9 mg/kg bodyweight. Since it is water soluble and mobile in soil environments, it is very likely to contaminate lakes and ground water, so a major exposure to it is by drinking contaminated water. Because of this, it is important to find out ways to biodegrade it. Sphingomonas sp. strain SB5, can degrade carbofuran into carbofuran-7-phenol and methylamine, hydrolyze carbofuran-7-phenol to 3-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)benzene-1,2-diol (DP-1), and then degrade DP-1 into a red metabolite (DP-2). More study is needed to identify this red metabolite ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080638|Kim et al., 2004]). Pseudomonas sp. 50432 is capable of hydroxylating carbofuran at the 4-position; further metabolites are unknown ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12351226|Chaudhry et al., 2002]).

It is also used as grain fumigant and a chemical intermediate in the production of refrigerants. Carbon tetrachloride is a widespread environmental pollutant due to improper disposal. Carbon tetrachloride can be degraded under anaerobic conditions via three different pathways. No enzyme is involved in these pathways; rather, reactions are catalyzed by cofactors present in microorganisms. The left-most pathway is a sequential two-electron reduction process. Carbon tetrachloride is degraded to chloroform, dichoromethane, chloromethane and ultimately methane by hydrogenolytic dechlorinations. Many anaerobic bacteria can catalyze the first two reactions of this pathway using the cofactors heme, factor F430, and corrinoids, such as aquocobalamin and methylcobalamin. These corrinoids can also convert CCl4 to carbon monoxide ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2001359|Krone et al., 1991]). This is part of the middle pathway, a simple two-electron reduction process in which chloroform is only a minor product. Carbon tetrachloride, in the right-most pathway, can be degraded via sulfur and oxygen substitution in one-electron reduction reactions.

This reduction is carried out by many different chromium resistant microorganisms.

Degradation of citronellol in Pseudomonas citronellolis, Pseudomonas mendocina, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa begins with oxidation of the alcohol and formation of the CoA ester which is converted to cis-geranyl-CoA. Linear terpenes, such as citronellol and geraniol, contain beta-methyl groups that inhibit beta-oxidation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/681275|Cantwell et al., 1978]). A key enzyme (geranyl-CoA carboxylase) in the degradation of these compounds converts the beta-methyl group to an acetate. The carboxylated intermediate undergoes hydratization and the actetate side group is eliminated by 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA lyase. The 7-methyl-3-oxo-ocanoyl-CoA product is readily assimilated via beta-oxidation. 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA is likely degraded via the leucine degradation pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16517656|Aquilar et al., 2006]).

The fungus Aspergillus niger J/8 N-demethylates diazepam to form 7-chloro-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one.

The first transformation in dibenzofuran degradation is effected by a three-component class IIA dioxygenase system, dibenzofuran 4,4a-dioxygenase, which attacks in angular position (acting upon a pair of carbons, one of which is involved in the bridge between two rings).

The sulfur product is incorporated into cellular biomass via sulfur assimilation pathways.

It is commercially available under names such as Prefix, Barrier, Casoron, Dyclomec and Norosac. Although dichlobenil does not readily leach to groundwater, it is quickly metabolized to 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM). Due to high water solubility and low sorption affinity in soil ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11455813|Albrechtsen et al., 2001]), the very persistant BAM has been detected in groundwater samples at levels which exceed current regulations ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18970297|Porazzi et al., 2005]). The first step in the microbial degradation of dichlobenil in previously exposed soils involves hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the benzamide. Further hydrolysis of the amide to a carboxylate is found to be much slower. Reductive dechlorination occurs both prior to, and after amide hydrolysis resulting in ortho-chlorobenzoate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17240021|Holtze et al., 2007]). This last compound has several known biodegradation pathways."

    "description": "Dichloromethane is a highly volatile solvent which finds application in a wide variety of industrial and commercial processes. It is used in paint removers, degreasing and cleaning fluids, and even as an extraction solvent in the decaffeination of coffee. Although dichloromethane is a potential carcinogen, the EPA Toxic Release Inventory reports that U.S. industrial discharges of dichloromethane amounted to 29,000 metric tons in 1994, down from 46,000 in 1990. The compound has an atmospheric half-life of several months, preventing it from reaching the stratosphere where it would be damaging to ozone. Both aerobic and anaerobic methylotrophic bacteria utilize dichloromethane as a carbon and energy source. A glutathione-dependent substitution which converts dichloromethane to inorganic chloride and formaldehyde (a central metabolite in methylotrophic growth) is the principal metabolic reaction in this degradation pathway. Dichloromethane dehalogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of this pathway, also known to initiate the degradation of dibromomethane (CH2Br2), chlorofluoromethane (CH2ClF), bromochloromethane (CH2BrCl), and diiodomethane (CH2I2). Dibromomethane has been observed to occur naturally ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7272274|Beissner et al., 1981])."

    "name": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide & Organosulfide Cycle",
    "description": "Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a major waste product from paper mills and is produced in nature in large amounts by biological and chemical oxidation of dimethyl sulfide. These two Hyphomicrobium species can grow aerobically with DMSO as sole source of carbon, energy, and sulfur. The first step in the pathway can also occur in many anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, which use DMSO as electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration, releasing dimethyl sulfide. Dimethyl sulfide is the major volatile sulfur compound released from the oceans, where it is derived from dimethylsulfaniopropionate. Dimethyl sulfide can also be produced in terrestrial ecosystems by this pathway. The first two steps in the DMSO biodegradation pathway use NADH for reducing power. Formaldehyde can be oxidized to CO2 to regenerate NADH. Hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of anaerobic bacterial respiration with sulfate as electron acceptor. It can be metabolized \"back\" to dimethyl sulfide by the enzyme thiol S-methyl transferase. This is the first pathway in the EAWAG-BBD which demonstrates a metabolic cycle (in this case, for organosulfide). For other organosulfide metabolisms, see thiocyanate pathway."

The persistent presence of SDS in domestic and industrial effluents have prompted manufacturers` attention on its biodegradation. Much research has shown that Pseudomonads have the capacity to degrade sulfate esters of long-chain primary alcohols. The biodegradation of dodecyl sulfate biodegradation is initiated with the liberation of inorganic sulfate by alkyl sulfatase, then the liberated alcohol is oxidized to lauric acid by an alcohol dehydrogenase through the alk pathway. The genetics and enzymology of the alk pathway have been investigated in detail. The alk genes are in two operons, alkBFGHJKL and alkST, which encode the proteins necessary for the degradation of five to twelve-carbon linear alkanes. At last, lauric acid is further degraded via beta-oxidation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1587481|Davis et al., 1992]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1453953|van Beilen et al., 1992])."

    "name": "Endosulfan",
    "description": "Endosulfan is a chlorinated cyclodiene pesticide used for over three decades in agriculture. Because it has been extensively applied directly to fields, it can be detected a considerable distance away from the original site of application. Contamination of drinking water and food, as well as detrimental effects to wildlife are important concerns ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12549541|Siddique et al., 2003)]. The EPA allows endosulfan to be present in food no more than 0.1 to 2 ppm. i The FDA prohibits levels above 24 ppm in dry tea. High doses of endosulfan in humans primarily affect the central nervous system, resulting in respiratory depression, dry mouth, convulsions, and possibly death. Low doses have been shown to compromise the immune system, liver, kidneys and reproductive system in animals. This compound has been shown to be highly toxic with oral LD50 values ranging from 18 to 160 mg/kg in rats. For dermal exposure, LD50 values in rats ranged from 78 to 359 mg/kg (EXTOXNET). Commercially available endosulfan exists as two diastereoisomers, alpha and beta, in a ratio of 7:3. The former is more volatile and thought to be more toxic ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12549541|Siddique et al., 2003] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17090129|Lee et al., 2006]). Thus, it is important to note that some microbial enzymes are specific to one isomer, or catalyze at different rates for each isomer ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15700124|Kwon et al., 2005]). For example, a Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESD enzyme degrades beta-endosulfan to the monoaldehyde and hydroxyether (depending on the reducing equivalent stoichiometry), but transforms alpha-endosulfan to the more toxic endosulfan sulfate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12450848|Sutherland et al., 2002a]). However, oxidation of endosulfan or endosulfan sulfate by the monooxygenase encoded by ese in Arthrobacter sp. KW yields endosulfan monoalcohol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16672499|Weir et al., 2006]). Both ese and esd proteins are part of the unique Two Component Flavin Dependent Monooxygenase Family, which require reduced flavin. They are conditionally expressed when no or very little sulfate or sulfite is available, and endosulfan is available to provide sulfur in these starved conditions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12174035|Sutherland et al., 2002b]). The references include more details about isomer specificity and rates. Alternatively, hydrolysis of endosulfan in some bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepaeia) yields the less toxic metabolite endosulfan diol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17289112|Kumar et al., 2006]). Endosulfan can spontanteously hydrolyze to the diol in alkaline conditions, so it is difficult to separate bacterial from abiotic hydrolysis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12450848|Sutherland et al., 2002a]). The diol can be converted to endosulfan ether ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17252313|Hussein et al., 2007)] or endosulfan hydroxyether ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12590478|Lee et al., 2003]) and then endosulfan lactone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12883876|Awasthi et al., 2003]). Hydrolysis of endosulfan lactone yields endosulfan hydroxycarboxylate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12833978|Walse et al., 2003]). These various branches of endosulfan degradation all result in desulfurization while leaving the chlorines intact, exhibiting the recalcitrance to bioremediation found in many organohalogen aromatics."

The anaerobic degradation of ethylbenzene is documented elsewhere in the EAWAG-BBD, and here the aerobic catabolism proceeds via two primary pathways. Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 10643 has been shown to utilize a wide range of n-alkylbenzenes (C2-C7), of which ethylbenzene is a single example. This degradation is initiated by a dioxygenation of the aromatic ring, leading to an extradiol ring cleavage. It is reported by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8795196|Lee & Gibson (1996)] that napthalene dioxygenase exhibits a highly relaxed substrate specificity and is capable of aerobically degrading ethylbenzene to styrene and/or 2-hydroxyacetophenone.

It is a major component of fossil fuels and their derivatives and is also a byproduct of coal-conversion and energy-related industries. It is commonly found in vehicle exhaust emissions, crude oils, motor oils, coal and oil combustion products, waste incineration, and industrial effluents. Fluorene is one of the compounds on the EPA Priority Pollutants List. This naphthenoaromatic compound bears structural relationships to other chemicals of concern (carbazoles, dibenzothiophenes, dibenzofurans, and dibenzodioxins) and is thus a useful model for biodegradation studies. The chemical structure of fluorene, including aromatic and alicyclic moieties, offers a variety of possibilities for biochemical attack. Two pathways for fluorene metabolism in Arthrobacter sp. strain F101 were suggested by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9055403|Casellas et al., 1997]. Compounds in brackets were not identified but postulated based on other experiments. A nonproductive route, initiated by monooxygenation at C-9, leads to the accumulation of 9-fluorenone. An alternative pathway is initiated by dioxygenation at C-1, C-2 or at C-3, C-4. The corresponding cis-dihydrodiols undergo dehydrogenation and then meta-cleavage which is catalyzed by an extradiol dioxygenase. After the aldolase reaction and decarboxylation of the fission product, the resulting indanones are substrates for a biological Baeyer-Villiger reaction, yielding the aromatic lactones 3-isochromanone and 3,4-dihydrocoumarin. 1-Indanone also appears to be a substrate for aromatic hydroxylation yielding 3-hydroxy-1-indanone, probably a dead-end product. Arene dioxygenases have been reported to act as monooxygenases hydroxylating methylene groups ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3365392|Wackett et al., 1988]). Another pathway, observed in Sphingomonas sp. LB126, Brevibacterium sp. DPO1361, and Pseudomonas sp. F274, was reported by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11766961|Wattiau et. al, 2001]. In this pathway, fluorene is converted to phthalic acid and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate by way of 9-fluorenone and a biphenyl intermediate. Other organisms which can metabolize fluorene include Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816/11 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8899998|Resnick et al., 1996]), Pseudomonas cepacia F297 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7487007|Grifoll et al., 1995]), and Staphylococcus auricularis strain DBF63 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8439154|Monna et al., 1993]).

Furfural can contaminate the product streams of lignocellulose breakdown in production of sugar from biomass.

Natural sources of theses compounds include plant flavonoids, tannins and lignin. Biodegradation occurs by aerobic pathways and anaerobic pathways in the absence of terminal electron acceptors. The initial step in the anaerobic gallate pathway used by Eubacterium oxidoreducens G41 is the decarboxylation of the ring ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/87194560|Krumholz et al., 1987]).

    "name": "Glyphosate",
    "description": "Glyphosate, also known by the trade name Roundup, is a broad-spectrum herbicide widely used in the United States and elsewhere. It is moderately biodegradable, largely due to soil microorganisms. It is representative of a broad class of compounds, known as phosphonic acids, which contain a direct carbon-to-phosphorus (C-P) bond. Although the C-P bond is chemically very stable, many bacteria, even enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, have the ability to enzymatically cleave the bond to liberate inorganic phosphate. In almost all studies of glyphosate metabolism, it was the sole source of phosphorous. However the organisms investigated were not capable of using it as a source of carbon or nitrogen. Because the pathway utilizing the intermediate aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) (pathway shown on the right below) has been found in organisms archived prior to the introduction of glyphosate, it has been postulated that the ability to degrade glyphosate is naturally present in the environment ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7946467|Kertesz et al, 1994]). However, the prevalence of the sarcosine intermediate pathway (shown on the left below) in isolates from glyphosate enriched sources ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632402|Dick and Quinn, 1995]) suggests that this pathway is selected for in these environments, possibly because the pathway is more favorable to the organisms. Glyphosate kills plants and bacteria by inhibiting the bacterial and plant enzyme enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Monsanto has developed a way to introduce a bacterial gene for a glyphosate-resistant EPSPS into plants, so that glyphosate can be used for weed control on otherwise glyphosate-susceptible crops."

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11944670|Kolpin et al. (2002)] found ibuprofen in about 10% of US streams studied. Sphingomonas sp. strain Ibu-2 can use ibuprofen as the sole source of carbon and energy. Isobutylcatechol and the two metabolites following it below were detected, suggesting that the propanoate side chain was removed prior to ring cleavage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16204529|Murdoc and Hays, 2005]). Further work determined that five genes, ipfABDFE, participate in ibuprofen catabolism. The degradation pathway starts by transferring Coenzyme A onto ibuprofen with the help of ATP. A dixoygenase forms cis-1,2-diol-2-hydroibuprofen-CoA. A thiolase then forms isobutylcatechol and propanoyl-CoA. This is the first report of a thiolase rather than a dehydrogenase forming such a catechol from a di- or monohydrodiol. Meta-cleavage of the isobutylcatechol produces 5-formyl-2-hydroxy-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoic acid, which then forms 2-hydroxy-5-isobutylhexa-2,4-dienedioic acid ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245937|Kagle et al., 2009])."

Iminodisuccinate degradation is initiated by an epimerase that interconverts the epimers (R,R)-iminodisuccinate, (R,S)-iminodisuccinate, and (S,S)-iminodisuccinate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16934291|Lohkamp et al., 2006]). The carbon-nitrogen bond in (R,S)-iminodisuccinate or (S,S)-iminodisuccinate, but not (R,R)-iminodisuccinate, is cleaved by iminodisuccinate lyase.

    "name": "Isoniazid",
    "description": "Isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide, INH) is a first-line antitubercular drug. A catalase-peroxidase (KatGII) in M. tuberculosis oxidizes INH, generating radical intermediates. These form NAD adducts that inhibit the inhA gene product, an enzyme critical for chain elongation in mycolic acid biosynthesis, which disrupts cell wall formation. Other adducts inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, which is critical for nucleotide biosynthesis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16648861|Argyrou et al., 2006]). Nitric oxide is also generated and confers antimycobaterial activity as well ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15273113|Timmins, 2004]). Biodegradation of isoniazid occurs in three principle branches: acetylation, hydrolysis, and deamination. Simple acetylation occurs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15447630|Westwood et al., 2005]). Subsequent hydrolysis by amidase has been demonstrated in rabbits ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10215642|Sarich et al., 1999]), but not yet in microbes. Hydrazinolysis into isonicotinate and hydrazine is carried out by Pseudomonas, Bacillus sp., and Sarcina sp. Deamination occurs in Mycobacterium bovis BCG via a catalase-peroxidase (KatG1). Both hydrazinolysis and deamination liberate isonicotinate. Hydrazine or ammonia ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16563633|Kang et al., 2005]) are the respective coproducts. Hydrazine can be anaerobically degraded to dinitrogen gas in anammoxosome-containing bacteria such as Candidata brocadia anammoxidans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15098544|van Niftrik et al., 2004;] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11404106|Jetten et al., 2001]). Isonicotinate itself is hydroxylated by Mycobacterium INA1 or Achromobacter sp. to form citrazinate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9682480|Schrader et al., 1998]). Several branches may then occur. Sarcina sp. carries out a hydrolysis pathway going to aconitamide, whereby deamination leads into common intermediary metabolism (RC Gupta and OP Shukla (1979) J. Biosci. (India), 1: 223-234.). Alternatively, succinic acid semialdehyde can form via ring cleavage of citrazinate by Achromobacter D ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8840783|Kaiser et al., 1996]). Another branch by the same species, as well as Achromobacter 4C1, cleaves the citrazinate ring into maleamate. Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter oxydans indirectly form maleamate from citrazinate via hydroxylation to trihydroxyisonicotinate, decarboxylation to 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine, and finally ring cleavage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8840783|Kaiser et al., 1996]). Peroxidation occurs via the catalase-peroxidase enzymes found in Mycobacterium sp. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15231844|Pierattelli et al., 2004]). The radical intermediates can form at least six different NAD and NADP adducts that are not depicted in this pathway, or may stabilize into isonicotinamide or isonicotinate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16648861|Argyrou et al., 2006]). There is some uncertainty regarding the catalase peroxidase enzymes, KatGI and KatGII; it is not currently agreed whether they are two subunits of one enzyme, or two separate enzymes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9371430|Menendez et al., 1997]). The position of the KatG genes on the bacterial genome makes them amenable to mutation, resulting in various structure homologies. This also contributes to isoniazid resistance."

Along with other branched alkanes, it is used to replace aromatic compounds in gasoline formulations in response to regulations limiting the release of the latter compounds. However, isooctane is itself toxic: in particular, numerous studies have shown that it causes kidney and liver damage in rats (for instance, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3680850|Fowlie et al., 1987]). Its quaternary carbon group makes isooctane one of the most recalcitrant constituents of gasoline. Nonetheless, Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2173 is able to use it as a sole carbon source ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10831416|Solano-Serena et al., 2000]). In addition to isooctane, this strain can degrade a variety of other hydrocarbons, including various n-alkanes, multimethyl-substituted isoalkanes, and monoaromatic hydrocarbons, and some ethers. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15281945|Solano-Serena et al. (2004)] have identified several of the intermediates in isooctane metabolism by M. austroafricanum IFP 2173. Isooctane is oxidized to 2,4,4-trimethylpentanoate, which is then likely ligated to coenzyme A and converted to 2,4,4-trimethyl-3-oxopentanoyl-CoA via beta-oxidation. Cleavage of propanoyl-CoA yields pivalyl-CoA, whose corresponding free form, pivalate, was observed. Pivalate is mineralized by M. austroafricanum IFP 2173, but the mechanism of its degradation is not well understood, and is not shown here. The authors suggest a pathway producing isobutyrate followed by methylmalonate, both of which are mineralized by isooctane-grown cells, as a reasonable hypothesis. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15281945|Solano-Serena et al. (2004)] also detected small amounts of 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanone and, in some cultures, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone produced during isooctane degradation by M. austroafricanum IFP 2173.

BN6 mineralised Mordant Yellow 3 to produce stoichiometric amounts of 6-Amino-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (6A2NS) and 5-Aminosalicylate(5AS) that were excreted into the growth media (under anoxic growth conditions). The enzyme catalysing this reduction is a highly non-specific azo reductase. Products of this step in turn become substrates for further degradation via the aerobic 6-Amino-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid pathway, initiated by naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase. This versatile enzyme has many other catalytic abilities, which are documented in a table of the Reactions of Naphthalene 1,2-Dioxygenase. Various biological systems have also been known to posess the capability to cleave the azo bond reductively under anaerobic conditions. In mammalian tissues, azo reductase activity is primarily found in the liver. Consequently intestinal flora have also been found to reduce azo bonds, namely Streptococcus faecalis. The degradative process for 6-Amino-2-Naphthalene sulfonic acid as well as 5 Aminosalicylate are both aerobic processes that are performed by two strains in conjunction namely Pseudomonas sp. BN6 and Pseudomonas sp. BN9. Strain BN6 under aerobic conditions catalyses the conversion of 6A2NS to 5AS with the release of pyruvate as an energy source. Strain BN9 (again under aerobic growth conditions) was found to be responsible for the biotransformation of 5AS to Fumarate and Pyruvate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8336104|Stolz and Knackmuss, 1992]). 5 AS which is identified as an intermediate in the bacterial degradation of aminonaphthalenesulfonates, has furtheremore been identified as an active agent in many drugs being developed for treatment of ulcerative colitis."

    "name": "Morpholine",
    "description": "Morpholine is a common organic synthesis reactant used in many industries ranging from petroleum refining to nuclear power generation. It is also a common component of organic syntheses of many pharmaceuticals. Worldwide morpholine production is estimated at nearly 25,000 tons per year. While morpholine itself has shown little toxicity beyond slight mucous membrane irritation in rats ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2731664|Harbison et al., 1989]), when in the natural environment its secondary amine functionality leads inevitably to nitrosation to form N-nitrosomorpholine, a well-characterized carcinogen as described by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11549020|Sielaff et al., 2001]. The large-scale annual usage of morpholine and its potentially carcinogenic effects motivate investigation of the metabolic pathways involved in its biodegradation. Morpholine degradation is completed primarily by the Mycobacterium genus. Morpholine monooxygenase is an important enzyme in this pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11549020|Sielaff et al., 2001]). This enzyme catalyzes the biotransformation of morpholine to 2-(2-aminoethoxy) acetic acid and contains a cytochrome P450 catalytic subunit ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848727|Shaikh et al., 2009]). Many different species of Mycobacterium have been shown to degrade morpholine via a shared group of degradation reactions for cyclic amines. The characterization of these reactions has been assayed by direct means but with little information about the enzymes involved in the reactions ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10335583|Combourieu et al., 1998])."

In the United States, 30% of people use an insect repellent containing DEET at least once a year ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11693870|McGready et al., 2001]). Annual domestic use equals approximately 1,800 tons ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17337538|Rivera-Cancel et al., 2007]). DEET was originally patented by the United States Army for use in insect-infested areas and was later registered for use by the general public. DEET is not known to have carcinogenic effects on humans (EXTOXNET; Pesticide Information Profile: DEET). While not carcinogenic, exposure to N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide does have human health effects including skin reactions and in rare cases of high-level exposure, seizures, toxic encephalopathy, acute manic psychosis and death (TOXNET; Hazardous Substances Data Bank; DEET). Hydrolysis of the amide bond in N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide yields 3-methylbenzoate and diethylamine. This transformation is catalyzed by the enzyme DEET hydrolase under aerobic conditions by the bacterium P. putida DTB. The resulting 3-methylbenzoate is then converted to 3-methylcatechol which can be further metabolized through the meta cleavage pathway of Pseudomonas putida ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17337538|Rivera-Cancel et al., 2007]). Diethylamine and ethylamine are both hydrolyzed to acetaldehyde before entering central metabolism ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1268229|Steenkamp et al., 1976]).

There are several studies examining mammalian degradation, but less is known about its microbial degradation. The microbial metabolism begins when toluene-4-monooxygenase converts NDMA to N-nitrodimethylamine (NTDMA) by oxygenating the nitrogen. Several other enzymes with broad specificity, like alkane monooxygenases, can transform NDMA as well. Some example organisms include: Rhodococcus ruber ENV425P, Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5, and Methylosinus trichospoium OB3b ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15672376|Sharp et al. 2005]). N-Nitrodimethylamine is transformed to N-nitromethylamine (NTMA) and formaldehyde, which funnel to intermediary metabolism. Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 transformed this compound but could not grow on it or mineralize it significant amounts, suggesting the reaction is cometabolic. However, other reactions in the NDMA microbial degradation pathway are not yet understood. NDMA is also thought to become demethylated to form methanol by an unidentified minor pathway that resembles the mammalian demethylation. Formaldehyde was shown not to be reduced to methanol in Pseudomonas KR1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16950909|Fournier et al., 2006]).

This practice is rare within the United States yet much is still sold outside the US for this purpose. In Arthrobacter nicotinovorans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7815950|Grether-Beck et al., 1994]) and Arthrobacter oxydans ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5835946|Gherna et al., 1965]), nicotine is converted to both (S)-6-Hydroxynicotine and (R)-6-Hydroxynicotine by nicotine dehydrogenase. Stereospecific enzymes (S)-6-hydroxynicotine oxygenase and (R)-6-hydroxynicotine oxygenase catalyze the formation of 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine which is degraded through 2,6-dihydroxypyridine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7815950|Grether-Beck et al., 1994]). Pseudomonas sp. strains P-34 and JTS-006 convert 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine to 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine, which forms 2,5- (rather than 2,6-) dihydroxypyridine ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5835946|Gherna et al., 1965]). Pseudomonas putida biotype A strain S16 uses a varient of this pathway. It delays 6-hydroxylation of the aromatic ring until the formation of 3-succinoylpyridine. This is hydroxylated to form 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine, and the remaining pathway for that is as shown here ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17464070|Wang et al., 2007]). The three end products of this degradation as shown here are Maleamate, 4-Aminobutyrate, and 2,6-Dihydroxy-N-methylmyosmine. The metabolism of Maleamate and 4-Aminobutyrate continue through regular microbial channels. 2,6-Dihydroxy-N-methylmyosmine formed spontaneously from 2,6-Dihydroxypseudooxynicotine is reported as metabolically inactive in this species.

    "name": "Nitrate (anaerobic)",
    "description": "As the highest oxidation state of nitrogen and one of the reactive, or \"fixed\", forms of nitrogen, nitrate can serve both as a source of nitrogen for growth and an electron sink. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate metabolism occurs in several, competing, microbial processes. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) and assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia retain the nitrogen in a fixed form, ammonia, keeping it available for further biological processes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409151|Zumft, 1997]). In contrast, denitrification ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409151|Zumft, 1997]) ultimately transforms nitrate to dinitrogen (N2), a gas that removes the nitrogen from the habitat, unless/until nitrogen fixation once again fixes the nitrogen. In the presence of nitrite, the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process also produces N2, by effectively combining nitrite with ammonia ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18340342|Keunen, 2008]). DNRA, denitrification, and anammox processes result in energy conservation and provide an electron sink. DNRA also functions to remove excess fixed nitrogen from an organism. Assimilatory nitrate reduction provides ammonia for biosynthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409151|Zumft, 1997]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21219945|Kraft et al., 2011]). Nitrate reduction by microorganisms is a major biogeochemical process. The flux through denitrification in the ocean is estimated to be 450 Tg N y-1 (Codispoti, LA, Brandes JA, Christensen, JP, Devol, AH, Naqvi, SWA, Paerl, HW and Yoshinari T, Scientia Marina, 65:Suppl.2, 85-105). In addition, the anammox pathway accounts for roughly 50% of fixed nitrogen turnover in marine environments ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16163345|Arrigo et al., 2005]). Nitrate concentrations are also an important issue in agricultural fertilizer use and wastewater treatment. Although plants can use nitrate as a nitrogen source, excess nitrate in bodies of water and in drinking water supplies can cause algal blooms and lead to public health problems, respectively ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21219945|Kraft et al., 2011]). The first step of the nitrate degradation pathway is the two electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite, which is accomplished by three classes of nitrate reductases in bacteria and archaea. Assimilatory nitrate reductases (NAS) are usually cytoplasmic and enable microbes to use environmental nitrate as a nitrogen source. Periplasmic nitrate reductases (NAP) perform redox balancing, scavenge nitrate in nitrate-limited environments, and serve in aerobic or anaerobic denitrification. Found in the membrane, respiratory nitrate reductases (NAR) enable the use of nitrate as a terminal electron sink in DNRA and in anaerobic denitrification ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16412515|Gonzï¿½lez et al., 2006]). Subsequently, nitrite can be reduced directly to ammonia, the most negative oxidation state of nitrogen. This reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA) or octoheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase in DNRA and by NAD(P)H-dependent nitrite reductase (NirB) in nitrite assimilation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21219945|Kraft et al., 2011]). In denitrification, nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide in a reaction catalyzed by copper nitrite reductase (NirK). The resulting nitric oxide is then reduced to nitrous oxide by nitric oxide reductase. Next, nitrous oxide is reduced to N2 by nitrous oxide reductase. Note that the release to the environment of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone layer depleter, can occur before the final reduction step to N2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409151|Zumft, 1997]). In anammox, nitrite is also reduced to nitric oxide, but the reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (NirS). Then, the relatively oxidized nitric oxide is combined with ammonia, which is comparatively reduced, to produce hydrazine in a reaction catalyzed by hydrazine synthase. Hydrazine dehydrogenase next removes electrons and the protons from hydrazine to make N2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964329|Kartal et al., 2011]). Found in the bacterial group Planctomycetes, annamox chemistry occurs in a specialized organelle, the anammoxosome, which has a ladderane lipid membrane, probably structured to protect the cell from the highly reactive pathway intermediates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18043610|Francis et al., 2007]). Finally, N2 from denitrification or anammox can be reduced to ammonia by nitrogenase in the energy intensive process of nitrogen fixation, catalyzed by nitrogenase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/164247|Zumft, 1975])."

As an important industrial chelating agent, NTA has been widely used for various radionuclide processing and decontamination procedures, such as textile, paper and pulp processing and water treatment. The extensive use of NTA has led to considerable concern about the potential of NTA to resolubilize and mobilize heavy metals from sediments and activated sludge, which would result in a contamination of drinking water with metal-NTA complexes. Fortunately, NTA is relatively easy to degrade. Many microorganisms, either in aerobic environments or under anaerobic or severely oxygen-limited conditions, can use NTA as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy. NTA biodegradation is initialized by nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase (aerobic) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9023192|Xu et al., 1997]) or nitrilotriacetate dehydrogenase (anaerobic) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8250558|Jenal-Wanner and Egli, 1993]), both of which hydroxylate NTA at an alpha-carbon atom and spontaneously form iminodiacetate (IDA) and glyoxylate. The nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase activity requires two component proteins, component A and B. Component A is an NTA monooxygenase which uses FMNH2 and O2 to oxidize NTA; component B is an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase that provides FMNH2 for NTA oxidization by using NADH to reduce FMN to FMNH2. In the follwing step, IDA is further converted to glycine and glyoxylate by iminodiacetate dehydrogenase."

The melting point of the technical material is 64-71C and the density is 1.80g/cm3 at 83C. It is used as a pre or post-emergence contact herbicide. Moderate application rates give selective control in cereals, certain ornamentals, vegetable crops, sugar beet and paddy fields. High application rates will give total vegetation control.

Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 is a very potent diphenyl ether herbicide metabolizing bacterium with broad substrate specificity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18778066|Keum et al., 2008]). The interesting aspect of the Nitrofen degradation by this strain is the initial reduction of nitro group followed by N-acetylation. As in other Sphingomonads, dissociation of the diaryl ether bond is also found in strain RW1 during Nitrofen metabolism. Although, ether bond clevage is a common metabolic pathway of diaryl ethers in animal, plant, fungi and bacteria, corresponding enzymes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes are different. Bacterial degradation of diphenyl ethers and related environmental contaminants are usually catalyzed by multi-component dioxygenase system, while eukaryotic biodegradation is catalyzed by monooxygenase or peroxidase ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11762605|Hiratsuka et al., 2001]) identified the degradation of diphenyl ether herbicides by the lignin-degrading basidomycete Coriolus versicolor.

Similar monooxygenase reactions in Arthrobacter sp. strain JS443 and Arthrobacter protophormiae RKJ100 remove nitrite from 4-nitrophenol or 4-nitrocatechol in preparation for ring cleavage ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8085840|Jain et al., 1994]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10772893|Chauhan et al., 2000]). Pseudomonas putida B2 and Alcaligenes sp. NyZ215 also employ a monooxygenase for the removal of nitrite from 2-nitrophenol to produce the ring cleavage substrate, catechol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3752997|Zeyer et al., 1986] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17616586|Xiao et al., 2007]). Under aneraobic conditions, Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134 and Pseudomonas putida B2 initially reduce the nitro group of 3-nitrophenol to form the hydroxylamino derivative. A mutase reaction, similar to the acid-catalyzed Bamberger rearrangement, converts 3-hydroxyaminophenol to aminohydroquinone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049374|Schenzle et al., 1999]) or 4-aminocatechol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10831408|Zhao et al., 2000]). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8085840|Meulenberg et al. (1996)] reported the formation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol, which is proposed to form via a monooxygenase-type oxidation and elimination of ammonia. Resorcinol is used in the manufacture of adhesives and dyes and as an ingredient in pharmaceutical preparations for the topical treatment of skin conditions. Phenol 2-monooxygenase hydroxylates resorcinol by reducing flavin with molecular oxygen."

    "name": "Nylon Oligomer",
    "description": "Nylon is a widely used synthetic polymer found in a variety of products, including carpeting, fabrics, electrical parts, and many other plastic applications. Total annual production is about 5.5 million tons worldwide. There are several variations of the polymer, the two most common being nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 (Wikipedia Nylon). Nylon is not considered a hazardous chemical, although its accumulation in landfills renders it a desirable recyclable commodity. Some investigation is under way as to whether nylon dust causes respiratory illness in those exposed to it ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11763480|Warheit et al., 2001]). Furthermore, the synthesis of adipic acid, a chemical used in production of nylon-6,6, produces large emissions of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide has a stronger greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (about 200 times), and is also thought to contribute to ozone layer degradation (Wikipedia Nitrous Oxide). The initial step in the degradation of nylon involves the transport of the compound across the outer membrane of the cell. Nylon 6 exists as a polymer in excess of 100 units. A few different enzymes are known to degrade nylon oligomers via different mechanisms. The endo-type hydrolases can cleave the oligomer in the middle of the molecule, and the exo-type hydrolase can only remove 6-aminohexanoyl groups from the N-terminus. The endo-type 6-aminohexanote oligomer hydrolase can degrade oligomers up to 20 units. It degrades oligomers into various sizes depending on which amide bond is hydrolized ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8285701|Kakudo et al., 1993]). The nylon linear dimer hydrolase is exo-type and can slowly degrade oligomers up to 6 units ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6305910|Negoro et al., 1983]). Thus, the following pathway could start with the hexamer and follow a slightly different order of successive oligomer metabolites, depending on the enzyme."

Its toxicity can result from three different forms of it, elemental (Hg0), mercuric ion (Hg2+), or organic mercury compounds. It can be absorbed through respiratory tract, skin, or digestive tract, and give rise to poisoning. Mercury toxicity is related to its affinity to form tight coordinate bonds with sulfhydryl groups diffusely disrupting enzyme systems in multiple organs such as brain, kidney, and lung. While mercury poisoning is still seen in some occupations, recently there has been much concern over the potential health hazards brought about by the contamination of many ecosystems. Different forms of mercury in the environment can be interconverted. Methylmercury may be formed in water and soil and accumulated in fish, which could cause mercury poisoning after ingestion. Phenylmercuric acetate has been used as a pesticide, herbicide, fungicide, disinfectant and a preservative in cosmetics. Methylmercury chloride has been used as a fungicide. Some bacteria are resistant to inorganic mercury salts and organomercurials including the above two compounds because they contain two enzymes for mercury conversion. Organomercurial lyase cleaves the C-Hg bond and releases Hg(II) in addition to the respective organic compound ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3542021|Begley et al., 1986]). Mercuric reductase reduces Hg(II) to Hg0, which is less reactive and toxic, and easily volatilizes from the medium ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2067577|Schiering et al., 1991]). In the reactions shown in the graphical pathway map, thiolates act as ligands to the mercury. This reflects observations that cellular thiols act to coordinate mercury during biological mercury transport and are likely going on and coming off the surface of the enzymes organomercurial lyase and mercuric reductase, respectively."

On agricultural crops it was used widely as a broad spectrum insecticide, acaricide, fumigant and nematocide. In 1991 parathion became a Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP). Parathion is well tolerated by crops, does not easily leach through soil and may be degraded by soil microorganisms within weeks. Degradation of parathion by sunlight or liver enzymes results in the active compound paraoxon which interferes with the nervous system through cholinesterase inhibition. Extreme toxicity combined with the ease of exposure has resulted in numerous human and non-pest species deaths. The immediate aerobic metabolic breakdown product of parathion, PNP or p-nitrophenol, was listed as a priority pollutant in 1979 by the US EPA. The main aerobic pathway involves initial hydrolysis of parathion to para-nitrophenol and diethylthiophosphoric acid (middle branch). The oxidation of parathion to paraoxon was observed, but was a minor contribution (right branch). It was not determined whether this reaction was enzyme-mediated or not; it is shown here as being enzyme-mediated, based on the known enzymic oxidation of diethtylthiophosphoric acid to diethylphosphoric acid, though since the reactions are not well-characterized, both reactions cannot be balanced. Under anerobic conditions, parathion was reduced to aminoparathion, which is hydrolyzed to p-aminophenol and diethylthiophosphoric acid (left branch) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8005|Munnecke & Hsieh, 1976])."

    "description": "Perchlorate is a hazardous industrial pollutant that does not occur naturally. Perchlorate consists of an atom of chlorine surrounded by four atoms of oxygen. It occurs as ammonium, potassium, magnesium or sodium salts. These perchlorate salts bind weakly to soil particles and are not significantly broken down in the environment (EPA, 1998). In water, however, perchlorate salts are extremely soluble and highly mobile, migrating faster and farther than many other water contaminants. Together, these properties make perchlorate a particularly persistent and problematic pollutant once it contaminates groundwater. Perchlorate salts are used in a variety of products as diverse as electronic tubes, car air bags, leather tanning and fireworks. Perchlorate`s main use is as an explosive propellant: Ninety percent of the perchlorate produced goes into solid rocket fuel for Air Force missiles and the NASA space shuttle. Perchlorate impairs normal thyroid function because it is taken up preferentially by the thyroid gland in place of iodide. The thyroid gland is therefore deprived of iodide, a necessary nutrient which it is designed to concentrate; and without iodine, thyroid hormone is inactive. As a result, perchlorate can disrupt the delicate balance of hormone levels in the body which are crucial for healthy metabolism, growth and development. Perchlorate-reducing bacteria use perchlorate ion as a terminal electron acceptor during the anaerobic oxidation of acetate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10583970|Coates et al., 1999]). Molybdenum is required as a cofactor. The overall stoichiometry of the pathway shown here is: CH3COO- + ClO4- -------> 2HCO3- + H+ + Cl- It is shown here as three discrete steps. However Dr. Coates states (personal communication, 2004) that presently: The perchlorate reductase and chlorate reductase enzymes are not consecutive in any organism. Some organisms reduce chlorate to chlorite using the chlorate reductase while some (the majority) reduce perchlorate to chlorite using the perchlorate reductase. It is unknown whether or not chlorate is produced as a transient intermediate in this reductive step."

Approximately 2 million pounds of permethrin are applied annually for agricultural, residential, and public health use in the United States (US EPA, 2009). Like other pyrethroid insecticides, permethrin has a higher insect to mammal ratio of toxicity than organochlorine or organophosphate insecticides ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19853000|Laffin et al., 2010]). Permethrin biodegradation begins with ester hydrolysis ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3145715|Maloney et al., 1988]), an initial step widespread in pyrethroid metabolism, to produce 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and the side chain carboxylate. 3-Phenoxybenzyl alcohol is oxidized to 3-phenoxybenzoate, a major intermediate in pyrethroid insecticide metabolism. It then undergoes angular 1,6 dioxygenation by phenoxybenzoate dioxygenase. The resulting dihydrodiol spontaneously cleaves its ether to produce phenol and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10820337|Halden et al., 2000]).

    "name": "Phenanthrene",
    "description": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as phenanthrene are commonly found as pollutants in soils, estuarine waters and sediments, and other terrestrial and aquatic sites. Although phenanthrene is not mutagenic or carcinogenic, it has been shown to be toxic to marine diatoms, gastropods, mussels, crustaceans, and fish. Phenanthrene is a tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Since it is the smallest aromatic hydrocarbon to have a \"bay-region\" and a \"K-region\", phenanthrene is often used as a model substrate for studies on metabolism of carcinogenic PAHs. Phenanthrene is degraded by some soil bacteria through one of two different routes. In one route,1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid is oxidized to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, which is further degraded via the Naphthalene Pathway to salicylate which can be further metabolized. In the other pathway, the ring of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid is cleaved and further metabolized via the Phthalate Pathway. It has been demonstrated that naphthalene and phenanthrene share a common upper metabolic pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8157614|Kiyohara H, et al. 1994]). In addition, the metabolism of phenanthrene by Streptomyces flavovirens and the marine cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6 is more similar to that reported in mammalian and fungal enzyme systems than those catalyzed by bacteria. Both oxidize phenanthrene to phenanthrene trans-9,10-dihydrodiol via a monooxygenase-epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed reaction rather than by a dioxygenase. The metabolic formation of 1-methoxyphenanthrene from phenanthrene was first reported in Synechococcus sp. PR-6. This organism may detoxify other 1-phenanthrols. The metabolic fate of 1-methoxyphenanthrene in Synechococcus sp. PR-6 remains to be elucidated. Fungi also can metabolize phenanthrene by utilizing monooxygenases and epoxide hydrolases. The fungal metabolic pathways of phenanthrene (9S,10S) also involve oxidative attack at the \"K-region\" of phenanthrene."

    "name": "Phenanthrene (fungal 9R,10R)",
    "description": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as phenanthrene are commonly found as pollutants in soils, estuarine waters and sediments, and other terrestrial and aquatic sites. Phenanthrene has been shown to be toxic to marine diatoms, gastropods, mussels, crustaceans, and fish. Phenanthrene has a fused-ring structure resembling higher molecular weight carcinogenic PAHs, and has received interest as a useful model PAH for mammalian and fungal studies. In general, bacteria that utilize phenanthrene as the sole source of carbon and energy oxidize it via a dioxygenase primarily in the \"bay-region\" to form a phenanthrene cis-dihydrodiol. In contrast to these bacteria, Streptomyces flavovirens and the marine cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum metabolize phenanthrene in the \"K-region\", mainly to phenanthrene trans-9,10- dihydrodiol with a 9S,10S absolute configuration similar to that produced by mammalian enzymes. Besides the bacterial metabolic pathways of phenanthrene , fungi are also able to biotransform phenanthrene. Unlike bacteria, fungi do not utilize phenanthrene as the sole source of carbon and energy but, instead cometabolize the PAH to hydroxylated products. Many nonligninolytic fungi metabolize phenanthrene in a highly redio- and stereoselective manner, via cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and epoxide hydrolase, to form phenanthrene trans-1,2-, trans-3,4, and trans-9,10-dihydrodiol; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 9-phenanthrols; and sulfate, glucoside, and glucuronide conjugates of primary metabolites. The fungi are known to biotransform phenanthrene to trans-dihydrodiol metabolites that are generally the mirror images of the corresponding trans-dihydrodiols obtained from rat liver microsomes. Although the 1,2-, 3,4-position (\"bay-region\") of phenanthrene is the main site of enzymatic attack, fungi are also able to transform phenanthrene at the 9,10-position ( \"K-region\"), which is a major site of mammalian enzymatic attack. The metabolic pathways and biochemical reaction mechanisms for the biotransformation of phenanthrene by these fungi closely resemble phase I (oxidation) and subsequent phase II (conjugation) metabolic pathways documented for terrestrial and aquatic animals. Cytochrome P-450, epoxide hydrolase, UDP-glucuronyltransferase, glycosyltransferase, and aryl-sulfotransferase activities have been demonstrated to be involved in the oxidation and subsequent conjugation of phenanthrene. 1-phenanthryl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and a novel phenanthrene glucoside conjugate, 2-hydroxy-1-phenanthrylbeta- D-glucopyranoside were produced by C. elegans ATCC 9245. The possible mechanism could involve two intermediates: trans-1,2-dihydrodiol and its dehydrogenated product 1,2-dihydroxyphenanthrene. 1-methoxyphenanthrene was identified only in A. niger van Tieghem (strain b52, DSM 11167) via methylation ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9212437|Thomas et al., 1997]). The five phenanthrols 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 9-phenanthrol were most likely produced by rearrangement of the postulated arene oxides (reactions: A, H, B, C, and D). After oxidative step in reaction E, a ring cleavage reaction may be involved in the enzymatic attack at C-9 and C-10 positions of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone to form 2,2`-diphenate in reaction F and eventually CO2 by mineralization (reaction G). The enzyme catalyzed step F has not been identified. The white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus produces trans-9R,10R-dihydrodiol phenanthrene as the principal enantiomer, which is different from that of the the principal eneantiomer produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. P. ostreatus can further cleave the aromatic ring and form 2,2`-diphenic acid and carbon dioxide. Ligninolytic Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been demonstrated to metabolize phenanthrene in a similar way to that of Pleurotus ostreatus (see: Phenanthrene (fungal 9S,10S) Pathway); however different enantiomers are produced in the first metabolic step in the two fungi."

Phenanthrene has been shown to be toxic to marine diatoms,gastropods, mussels, crustaceans, and fish. Besides the bacterial metabolic pathways of phenanthrene , fungi can also metabolize phenanthrene. Nonligninolytic (i.e., high-N) cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium fit the typical eukaryotic pattern. They metabolize phenanthrene to trans-dihydrodiols and phenanthrene conjugates. Phenanthrene trans-9,10- and trans-3,4-dihydrodiols are formed by the successive activities of monooxygenases and epoxide hydrolases. The regiospecificity of P. chrysosporium differs from that of Cunninghamell elegans, which principally produces the trans-1,2- dihydrodiol with smaller amounts of the trans-3,4-dihydrodiol. There was no metabolism at 9, 10- positions (\"K-region\") of phenanthrene as evidenced by the failure to detect trans-9,10-dihydrodiols. The three phenanthrols were most likely produced either by dehydration of the trans-dihydrodiols or by rearrangement of the postulated arene oxides (reactions: A, B, J, K, C and D). Similarly, in Cunninghamell elegans, 1-phenanthrol was produced via dehydration of the corresponing trans-1,2-dihydrodiols (reaction I). The novel 9-phenanthryl-beta -D-glucopyranoside produced by P. chrysosporium differs from the 1-phenanthryl-beta- D-glucopyranoside produced by C. elegans. Those conjugates may be considered detoxification products of phenanthrene. Unlike nonligninolytic Phanerochaete chrysosporium, ligninolytic Phanerochaete chrysosporium does not accumulate trans-dihydrodiols and phenanthrols ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1622259|Hammel KE, et al., 1992]). It gives 2,2`-diphenic acid (DPA) as a major fate of phenanthrene by 9,10-oxidation and ring cleavage (reactions E and F). These two reactions could involve multiple steps. However, no intermediates were reported so far. The oxidation of phenanthrene-9,10-quinone (PQ) to DPA involves both fungal and abiotic mechanisms, and is unaffected by the level of nitrogen added. Phenanthrene degradation by ligninolytic P. chrysosporium involves both ligninolytic and nonligninolytic enzymes and is not initiated by a classical microsomal cytochrome P-450. In reaction H, 2,2`-biphenyldimethanol occurred as a minor phenanthrene metabolite which was probably a reduction product of DPA. Both phenanthrene and PQ could be mineralized to similar extents by this kind of fungus. For reaction G, it is likely that some DPA formed from phenanthrene and PQ was further degraded, but it remains uncertain whether DPA is an obligatory intermediate in phenanthrene. Metabolism of phenanthrene by Phanerochaete chrysosporium, A.quadruplicatum PR-6, and S. flavovirens all produce phenanthrene trans-9S,10S-dihydrodiol as the predominant metabolite. However, the cytochrome P-450 and epoxide hydrolase of P. ostreatus, C. elegans, and S. racemosum favor the stereoselective formation of phenanthrene trans-9R,10R-dihydrodiol."

According to the EXTOXNET Phorate Pesticide Information Profile, single-time exposure at high doses can interfere with cholinesterase activity leading to numbness, headache, dizziness, nausea, a difficulty breathing, and slow heartbeat and if the dose is too high, potentially death. Long-term, low-dose exposure primarily targets the nervous system, with little evidence supporting any teratogenic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic effects. Degradation of phorate occurs in two branches. The left branch is a two-step oxidation of the ethylthio sulfur ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/402103|Laveglia and Dahm, 1977]). In the right branch, Ralstonia eutropha strain AAJ1 degrades a high percentage of phorate to phosphate and sulfate anions, with the less toxic diethyl dithiophosphate as one intermediate (Rani et al., 2009). The reaction intermediates diethylthiophosphate, ethylthiophosphate and coproduct ethanol are postulated, though diethylthiophospate is observed in parathion degradation. The initial reaction in the right branch, resulting in the formation of diethyl dithiophosphate, is not well characterised."

    "name": "Phthalate Family",
    "description": "Phthalic acid diesters, also called phthalates, are used industrially in the production of a variety of household and consumer goods including plastic polymers, lubricating oils, and carriers for perfumes in cosmetics. Because of their widespread use, phthalates have become one of the most abundant industrial pollutants in the environment. Several phthalates are classified as toxic chemicals in the EPA`s Toxics Release Inventory Program. Phthalic acid (phthalate) is used industrially as a plasticizer. Terephthalate is used in the synthesis of polyethylene terephthalate (abbreviated PET or PETE), a plastic polymer with many commercial uses including the production of plastic beverage bottles. Phthalates in the environment show a moderate resistance to bacterial degradation, but are easily degraded in the laboratory. Pseudomonas cepacia, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1, and Arthrobacter keyseri 12B all convert phthalate to a cis-dihydrodiol. Ps. cepacia produces the 4,5-dihydrodiol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2841671|Ballou & Batie, 1988]), and M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17085566|Kim et al., 2007]) and A. keyseri 12B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371533|Eaton, 2001]) produce the 2,3-dihydrodiol. These are transformed into the respective dihydroxy compounds, both of which can be decarboxylated to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate). Comanonas testosteroni strains can convert terephthalate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8565920|Wang et al., 1995]) and 4-hydroxyphthalate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563|Nakazawa & Hayashi, 1978]) to protocatechuate. A Micrococcus sp. strain can decarboxylate 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7125802|Eaton & Ribbons, 1982]). Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is able to use monoalkyl esters including methyl, butyl, hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl phthalates as its sole carbon and energy source. Suspensions of cells grown on phthalate could degrade dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dihexyl and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalates. The major metabolites of the dialkyl esters are corresponding monoalkyl esters and phthalate. Demethylation of the alkyl side chains was also observed as a concurrent minor process. The degradation of dibutyl phthalate is provided here as an example and other phthalate esters follow similar pathways ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20038686|Hirofumi et al., 2010]). The biodegradation of dimethylisophthalate ester, another model phthalate ester, is found elsewhere."

    "name": "Picric Acid Family",
    "description": "Picric acid (2,4,6-Trinitrophenol), a derivative of phenol, is a yellow solid. Picric acid is mainly used in manufacture of explosives and as an intermediate in dye manufacturing. Both 2,4,6-trinitrophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol are found in the waste streams released into the environment by aniline production plants. The three nitro groups of picric acid create a highly positive redox potential that is susceptible to reductive rather than oxidative processes. An initial reductive attack on the aromatic ring converts picric acid to the hydride-TNP Meisenheimer complex. In Rhodococcus (opacus) erythropolis HL PM-1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1444408|Lenke et al., 1992]), Nocardioides sp. strain CB 22-2 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10103224|Behrend and Heesche-Wagner, 1999]) and Nocardioides simplex (formerly Arthrobacter) FJ2-1A, ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10217752|Ebert et al., 1999]) elimination of nitrite is thought to proceed through this intermediate. However, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9973345|Rieger et al. (1999)] states this elimination requires an unlikely C-3 to C-2 hydrogen migration. Studies show that C-2 protonation of the hydride species occurs readily at physiological pH and suggests the protonated hydride complex is the reactive intermediate for nitrite elimination to 2-dinitrophenol. Reduction of the aromatic nucleus in 2,4-DNP forms the hydride-DNP Meisenheimer complex. A second pathway involves a two component enzyme system which catalyzes two hydration reactions of picric acid to form a dihydride Meisenheimer-complex ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11882715|Heiss et al. 2002]). The nitro form of this dihydride complex remains as a dead-end metabolite; the aci form undergoes elimination of nitrite, after which the two metabolic pathways of picric acid merge ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11995829|Ebert et al., 2001]). The enzyme catalyzing denitration of the dihydride Meisenheimer-complex of picric acid to form the hydride Meisenheimer-complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol and also the hydrolase enzyme for subsequent reaction have been recently purified ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15128543|Hofmann et al., 2004]). It has been known for more than a decade that 4,6-dinitrohexanoate undergoes further mineralization, with a minor amount remaining as a dead-end metabolite ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1444407|Lenke et al., 1992]).

Numerous bacterial strains able to degrade pivalic acid have been isolated, including members of families Rhodocyclaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae, , and two pathways were proposed ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12620885|Probian et al., 2003]). After activation with a CoA forming ligase, a pivalyl-CoA mutase is considered to isomerize the quarternary compound. In contrast to the originally proposed pathway, recent studies showed that 3-methylbutyryl-CoA is the product (Katja Zerbe and Jens Harder, personal communication, 2004). In an alternative pathway, strain PIV-34-1, a member of Oxalobacteraceae which is closely related to genus Herbaspirillum, is proposed to degrade pivalate via an anaerobic oxidation of the methyl group, with dimethylmalonate as the initial product ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12620885|Probian et al., 2003])."

    "description": "The bacteria that degrade propylene were initially studied for their potential to degrade chlorinated alkenes and produce optically pure epoxides ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7592382|Small, 1995]). The first metabolite of the propylene degradation pathway is 1,2-Epoxypropane. This compound is an aliphatic epoxide with known stereochemistry of 95% (R)-1,2-Epoxypropane and 5% (S)-1,2-Epoxypropane. Aliphatic epoxides have been extensively studied because of their toxicity, mutagenicity and potential carcinogenicity ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/370573|Wade, 1978]). The study of propylene degradation will help to understand the way in which toxic alkene epoxides are degraded by bacteria. Propylene is also a source of carbon and energy for different bacteria such as Xanthobacter Py2. The degradation of propylene leads two compounds that can go into intermediary metabolism, acetoacetone and actetone. The reaction that produces these intermediates is catalyzed by an interesting epoxide carboxylase. In the presence of carbon dioxide this enzyme converts propylene oxide into acetoacetate. When carbon dioxide is not present, there is an enzyme artifact that releases the intermediate from the enzyme active site as acetone. Epoxide carboxylase is a four-component \"multiprotein enzyme system\". Each of the four enzyme component functions independently of the others: Component I is epoxyalkane:CoM transferase, Components III and IV are stereoselective 2-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenases, Component II is a dual function NADPH:2-ketopropyl-CoM oxidoreductase/carboxylase. In addition, Allen et al. (1999) reported that coenzyme M (2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid), which serves as a C3 carrier during the reaction, is a central cofactor of propylene oxide carboxylation. Coenzyme M previously was only found in the methanogenic Archaea, where it plays a central role in the reductive formation of methane."

There are two distinct yet related bacterial pathways for the degradation of pyridoxine. The bacteria that carry out these reactions can use pyridoxine as their sole carbon source. The first step in each pathway is a dehydrogenation reaction; in pathway I it is at the 4 position, and in pathway II it is at the 5 position. After this step, both pathways proceed through a series of pyridine compounds before ring cleavage, but none of the pyridine intermediates are common to both pathways ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3771566|Nelson et al., 1986])."

    "name": "Selenate",
    "description": "Selenium is naturally found in fossil fuels, shales, alkaline soils and as a constituent in over 40 minerals (i.e. ferroselite, challomenite, schmeiderite). Extensive deaths and deformities in waterfowl and other wildlife are attributed to micromolar concentrations of selenium at the Kesterton reservoir. The soluble oxyanions selenate (Se(VI)) and selenite (Se(IV)) are the primary forms of selenium in oxic environments. Se(VI) does not readily undergo chemical reduction under physiological conditions of pH and temperature. The toxicity of selenium involves the substitution of selenium for sulfur in thiol-containing proteins. In animals, selenium toxicity is conferred primarily by ingestion of food that is rich in seleniferous compounds (e.g. selenomethionine). Selenium poisoning can result in conditions known as alkali disease and the blind staggers. Plants and microbes can incorporate inorganic selenium oxyanions into their tissues by assimilatory reduction to the level of selenide, followed by their assembly into proteins. At present, only the selenate reductase of Thauera selenatis has been well-characterized. This enzyme is a periplasmic, trimeric enzyme that is very substrate specific and contains molybdenum. It reduces four molecules of selenate to four molecules of selinite ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525169|Stolz and Oremland, 1999]). Selenate respiring bacteria have been shown to occur in a wide range of environments and not confined to any specific genus. The full impact of their activities on the biogeochemical cycling of selenium is only now being realized. Furthermore, these organisms, and perhaps the enzymes themselves, may be useful in the bioremediation of selenium-contaminated environments."

    "name": "Starch Oligomer",
    "description": "Starch is a polymer of glucose in which the monomers are connected via an alpha-1,4 glucosidic bond. Plants make starch to store glucose, as it can be broken down again to glucose when carbon and energy are needed. For this purpose, animals and fungi make glycogen, an alpha-glucan polymer more highly cross-linked than starch. The starch oligomer maltotriose, which is a glucose trimer connected via alpha-1,4-linkages, serves as a model for starch (or glycogen) degradation. The two most common ways of cleaving alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds involve glycoside hydrolases or Type-1 polysaccharide lyases (for example, pectate lyase). The third known way to cleave alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds is found in the Anhydrofructose pathway ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18785261|Yu et al., 2008]), in which the glucosidic bonds in starch (or glycogen) oligomers are cleaved by alpha-1,4-glucan lyase, a Type-2 polysaccharide lyase. From the nonreducing polymer end, alpha-1,4-glucan lyase releases 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose, a central intermediate from which microorganisms can make a variety of end products ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10446355|Yu et al., 1999]). In bacteria, the 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose intermediate is converted to 1,4-anhydro-D-glucitol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880813|Shiga et al., 1999]), or 1,4-anhydro-D-mannitol ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16461673|Kuhn et al., 2006]). The 1,4-anhydro-D-glucitol undergoes phosphorylation to 1,4-anhydro-glucitol-6-phosphate and then dehydrogenation to 1,4-anhydro-fructose-6-phosphate. The 1,4-anhydro-D-mannitol is monooxygenated to make D-mannose, which can enter intermediary metabolism."

    "name": "Tetralin",
    "description": "Tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) is a widely used organic solvent for fats, resins and waxes. It can also be found in many household products like paints, lacquers and shoe polishes. Tetralin absorbed in cells may form toxic hydroperoxides and inhibit bacterial growth in concentrations higher than 100 micromoles/liter. Due to its lipophilic nature, tetralin accumulates in cell membranes resulting in structural and functional changes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12324329|Hernaez et al., 2002]). Camphor 5-monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida PgG 786 and Pseudomonas stutzeri AS39 catalyzes the conversion of tetralin to (R)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol. Oxidation of the alcohol yields 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalone ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806731|Grayson et al., 1996]). Corynebacterium sp. strain C125 is capable of growing on tetralin as a sole source of carbon. Degradation proceeds via a series of reactions involving hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, extradiol cleavage, and hydrolytic attack ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8434923|Sikkema et al., 1993]) ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12324329|Hernaez et al., 2002]). Tetralin is ultimately converted to pyruvate, an intermediary metabolite, and 7-oxoheptanoate (pimelic semialdehyde). This last compound, in Methanosarcina thermophila, can serve as a precursor to Coenzyme B ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9665716|Howell et al., 1998])."

    "name": "Thiamin",
    "description": "Thiamin and thiamine diphosphate act as a critical cofactor in many pathways such as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Thiamin is essential to all living organisms, and in humans, its deficiency causes greater problems than its excess intake (thiamin toxicity is uncommon). Since humans cannot synthesize thiamin, thiamin synthesis by microorganisms is important. Biodegradation of thiamin is important for its recycling and de novo biosynthesis; therefore, thiamin biodegradation is also called thiamin salvage. Thiamin salvage is essential for the survival of bacteria when thiamin is limited. It also occurs in some archaea and eukaryotes. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17618314|Jenkins et al. (2007)] describe how formylaminopyrimidine and 5-hydroxy-3-sulfanylpentan-2-one are generated from thiamin hydrolysis in the presence of soil. Bacillus halodurans can then deformylate formylaminopyrimidine to aminopyrimidine using an amidohydrolase, and can further hydrolyze aminopyrimidine to toxopyrimidine using thiaminase II."

The antibiotic sulfinemycin, produced by Streptomyces albus NRRL 3384, has a primary thioamide S-oxide moiety ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7730167|Lee et al., 1995]). Thioacetamide is used as a sulfur source for organic syntheses and has applications in leather, textile, paper, rubber, and petroleum industries. 2,6-Dichlorothiobenzamide (chlorthiamid) is used as an herbicide. Thioamide compounds such as 2-ethyl-4-pyridinecarbothioamide (ethionamide) are important second-line drugs in the treatment of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12164478|Schroeder et al., 2002]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3910748|Shepard et al., 1985]).

Thioamide S-oxides are not toxic without further oxygenation and investigators have proposed that thioamide S,S-dioxides (which have not been isolated) or further oxidized species exert the observed toxic effects (Vannelli et al., 2002; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6135576|Hanzlik and Cashman, 1983]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28917|Porter and Neal, 1978]).

Ralstonia pickettii TA can grow using thioacetamide as a sole source of nitrogen and carbon ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16997975|Dodge et al., 2006]), but the pathway of degradation has not been completely determined. Thioacetamide S-oxide was detected as a metabolic intermediate, supporting an oxygenase-mediated mechanism. During thioacetamide degradation, 3,5-dimethyl-1,2,4-thiadiazole accumulated in the medium and was not further metabolized. This species did not form when thioacetamide and thioacetamide S-oxide were combined. Therefore it was proposed that a further oxidized species, possibly thioacetamide S,S-dioxide, reacts with thioacetamide to form this dead-end metabolite. Sulfur eliminated from thioacetamide during metabolism was detected in the medium as sulfur dioxide/sulfite. Elimination of sulfur at this oxidation state from thioacetamide S,S-dioxide requires an additional two-electron oxidation, which occurs by an unknown mechanism. Nitrogen released during thioactamide degradation was detected as ammonium ion. Using thiobenzamide metabolism by this strain as a model ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16997975|Dodge et al., 2006]), it was predicted that elimination of the thioacetamide sulfur would generate acetonitrile and/or acetamide. R. pickettii TA grew using acetonitrile or acetamide as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, but neither could be detected during thioacetamide degradation, possibly because hydrolysis of these substrates was rapid relative to sulfur elimination ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16997975|Dodge et al., 2006])."

    "name": "Thiocyanate",
    "description": "Thiocyanate is one of the major constituents of waste water from factories for the gasification of coal, where various by-products are formed during the production of gas for fuel, coke, and substances for chemical industries. Cyanide is usually converted to thiocyanate by the addition reaction of sulfur since thiocyanate is less toxic than cyanide. The resultant thiocyanate is then treated to an activated sludge process, where microbes degrade this substance. Thiobacillus thioparus, which is a chemolithoautotrophic sulfur bacterium, can obtain energy by degradation of thiocyanate. Thiocyanate hydrolase, a newly found enzyme from Thiobacillus thioparus catalyzes the conversion of thiocyanate to carbonyl sulfide and ammonia. A model for the sequential reaction steps for thiocyanate hydrolase was presented, which involves four intermediates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1577754|Katayama et al., 1992]). Carbonyl sulfide can be reduced by nitrogenase to carbon monoxide in Azotobacter vinelandii. The FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase`s molybdenum-iron protein was proposed to participate in this reaction, which may involve two intermediates ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7727396|Seefeldt et al., 1995]). In addition, carbon disulfide can be oxidized to carbonyl sulfide by an oxygenase in P. denitrificans. This process could be analogous to that seen in rat liver, in which carbon disulfide is oxidized by a P-450-containing NADPH-monoxygenase to produce monothiocarbonate (hydrated COS), rather than free COS itself, and \"active sulfur\" [S]. Carbon monoxide can be oxidized to carbon dioxide by methane monooxygenase in Methylococcus capsulatus, by carbon monoxide oxygenase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase in many microbes. Thiocyanate can also be utilized by the heterotrophic bacterium 26B. Thiocyanate is hydrolyzed to cyanate and sulfide by an inducible enzyme in reaction A. Cyanate is hydrolyzed further to carbon dioxide and ammonia by cyanase. Cyanase activity in isolate 26B is also inducible and has been shown to hydrolyze cyanate under anaerobic conditions. Sulfide is oxidized to produce tetrathionate via the formation of thiosulfate. The ability to convert thiosulfate to tetrathionate is constitutive in reactions B and C. No further oxidation of tetrathionate occurred in a variety of heterotrophic bacteria. However, in T. tepidarius, thiosulfate can be oxidized to sulfate with the obligatory formation of tetrathionate as an intermediate.

Many different thiophene compounds are naturally produced in plant roots, especially in plants of the Tagetes genus ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12228405|Jacobs et al., 1995]).

In this pathway, T2C is ligated to CoA, oxidized, and then undergoes ring opening with the subsequent loss of sulfide. Hydrolysis releases the intermediary metabolite, 2-oxoglutarate, from the CoA. T2C-CoA thioesterase activity, which regenerates T2C from T2C-CoA, has also been detected ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9531630|Bambauer et al., 1998]).

(1994)]), and the classification therein is based on the time of desulfonation: prior to (two different mechanisms), simultaneous with, or after ring cleavage. Catabolism of toluene-4-sulfonate (TS or TSA), a dye precursor, may progress in accordance with two of the four mechanisms, both involving desulfonation prior to ring cleavage. The left pathway presented below is unique in that the initial step does not involve an oxygenation of the sulfonated carbon, but monooxygenation of the methyl group. However, the final, desulfonating step is a dioxygenation catalyzed by Fe2+-activated 4-sulfobenzoate 3,4-dioxygenase. Alicaligenes sp. strain O-1 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8075807|Junker et al.

The middle pathway below reproduces the initial desulfonation reaction of TS, which can be catalyzed by 2-aminobenzenesulfonate dioxygenase system (2ASDOS) or benzenesulfonate dioxygenase system (BSDOS). There is a EAWAG-BBD reaction page for each enzyme. Little is known about the details of the transformation of TS into 4-hydroxytoluene, although further investigation is currently underway. `Toluene-4-sulfonate monooxygenase` is a proposed name, and 1.14.13.- a proposed E.C. code, for the reaction enzyme. Pseudomonas putida strain S-313 catalyzes only desulfonation of TS, which can serve as its sole source of sulfur.

The National Cancer Institute nominated triethanolamine for study because of its widespread use in cosmetics and other consumer products, its high potential for worker exposure due to its many industrial uses, and its potential for conversion to the carcinogen N-nitrosodiethanolamine. Triethanolamine is degraded by the enzyme triethanolamine lyase. A corronoid-dependent shifting of the terminal hydroxyl group to the subterminal carbon atom occurs to form an unstable intermediate that forms diethanolamine and releases acetaldehyde. It is believed that the diethanolamine formed by this reaction undergoes a similar degradation route to form ethanolamine. Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase degrades the ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and ammonia. A strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, strain LuTria 3, was used to degrade the triethanolamine. Acetobacterium sp. LuTria 3 was enriched and isolated with triethanolamine as sole source of energy and carbon. The new isolate differs from other species of the genus described so far by its capacity to grow with triethanolamine and its inability to utilize ethylene glycol or fructose ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8085913|Frings et al., 1994])."

It is commonly known as TNT and is an explosive used in military shells, bombs, and grenades, in industrial uses, and in underwater blasting. TNT production in the United State occurs solely at military arsenals. Accidental release of TNT has contaminated groundwater and soil at numerous munition manufacturing sites. The U.S. EPA has listed TNT as a priority pollutant and has recommended its removal from contaminated sites. TNT is toxic to algae and invertebrates and chronic exposure to TNT by humans causes harmful health effects, including anemia and abnormal liver function, cataract development, and skin irritation. The EPA has determined that TNT is a possible human carcinogen, based on animal studies. This page shows only aerobic TNT degradation pathway. Its anaerobic degradation is documented elsewhere in the EAWAG-BBD. Microbial transformation of TNT usually begins with reduction of one of the nitro groups. The enzymes which catalyze these reductions are \"non-specific\" NAD(P)H dependent nitroreductases and are largely uncharacterized. One exception is a nitrobenzene nitroreducatase, purified from P. pseudoalcaligenes JS52, which can transform TNT to the mono- and dihydroxylamino intermediates. As its name suggests, this enzyme was originally found to reduce nitrobenzene. Aerobic bacteria are able to reduce 2 of the 3 nitro groups of TNT; the reduction of the third nitro group requires anaerobic conditions. While denitration is often a major reaction in the biodegradation of nitrosubstituted compounds, bacterial denitration of TNT or its reduction products has been demonstrated in only a few cases. One example is shown below in which 2-amino-4-nitro-toluene is produced from 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene. In addition, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9198535| Martin et al. (1997)] showed that P. savastanoi can generate 2,4-dinitrotoluene from TNT. The formation of Meisenheimer complexes from TNT has been described in at least 3 bacterial strains, including Rhodococcus erythropolis and Mycobacterium sp. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16349484|Vorbeck et al., 1998]). These complexes result from the nucleophilic attack by a hydride ion on the aromatic ring. Formation of the hydride complexes could not be identified with the recently isolated TNT-enriched strains TNT-8 and TNT-32, nor with Pseudomonas sp. strain A (2NT-). However, these strains are able to carry out nitro-group reduction, as shown below. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9687442|French et al. (1998)] demonstrated that the enzyme pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase from Enterobacter cloacae catalyzes the formation of both the hydride- and dihydride-Meisenheimer complexes. Generally, complete mineralization of TNT is only detected with bacterial consortia. Many of the products of TNT biodegradation are highly reactive and covalently bind to cellular components and any solid supports (such as soil) present in the medium. The latter prevents or prolongs the mineralization process, but also hinders a further spread of TNT contaminants. Several authors have noted the formation of, as yet, unidentified compounds during TNT biodegradation. These have not been included in the pathway map."

It can detrimentally impact the environment. Reaction A is non-enzymic, catalyzed by a microbially-associated low-molecular-weight compound called TPT-Degrading Factor (TPT-DF). TPT-DF is most likely a pyoverdine, which is a yellow-green chromopeptide siderophore with a molecular mass of 1,000 to 1,500 Da, or a pyoverdine analog ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10919812|Inoue et al., 2000])."

    "name": "Tyrosine",
    "description": "Tyrosine is one of the 20 common amino acids found in all biological systems. It is catabolized as part of normal intermediary metabolism and in the breakdown of external proteins by soil microorganisms. Although it is not a xenobiotic compound, some of the intermediates of this pathway are also found in pathways for the catabolism of industrial and natural product aromatic ring compounds. One or more of these pathways are often found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative soil bacteria. In addition, Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 is able to convert 4-chlorophenylacetate to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate. The latter merges into the pathway."

    "description": "Uranium (U) is the most common radionuclide contaminant at US Department of Energy facilities (Riley et al., DOE/ER-0547T, 1992). More information on this element can be found at the Web Elements U page. The uranyl ion [U(VI)O2]2+ is a common, soluble form of this element in the environment. Microbes can immobilize uranyl ion in several ways, three of which are shown here. The mineral uraninite, U (IV)O2, is highly insoluble. Microbes can reduce uranyl ion to hydrated uraninite. The reduction can be carried out by a cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8285665|Lovley et al., 1993]) and other organisms, as shown in the left-most pathway branch. Reaction A, in the middle branch, can be carried out by Deinococcus radiodurans R1 in the laboratory with concomitant oxidation of the humic acid analog anthranhydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDSH2) to its quinone form ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10788374|Fredrickson et al., 2000]). Humic acid, a brown-colored mixture of polymers, found in lignite, peat, and soils, is assumed to be the environmental cofactor. Uranyl ion can be precipitated as cell-bound hydrogen uranyl phosphate without change in oxidation state of the uranium, as shown in the right-most pathway branch. This reaction is facilitated by acid phosphatase N from Citrobacter sp. N14 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9763695|Basnakova et al., 1998])."

This molecule contains an azoxy group and is being studied to learn more about the synthesis of naturally occurring azoxy compounds ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12688722|Tao et al., 2003]. Valanimycin is synthesized by condensation of L-serine with isobutylhydroxylamine; the latter compound is produced from L-valine via isobutylamine. A key step in the synthesis pathway, the oxidation of isobutylamine to isobutylhydroxylamine, is catalysed by a two-component flavin monooxygenase. The two components are isobutylamine N-hydroxylase and NAD(P)H:FAD oxidoreductase. The second component is required to provide reduced flavin cofactor since isobutylamine N-hydroxylase is unable to reduce FAD or FMN on its own. Purification of isobutylamine N-hydroxylase from Streptomyces viridifaciens has been reported ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9056232|Parry et al., 1997]). The exact mechanism of N-N bond formation is not very clear. However, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12688722|Tao et al.

It is not clear whether the enzymes from B. pallidus here named \"alpha-pinene dehydrogenase\" and \"alpha-pinene monooxygenase\" are the same enzyme or two different enzymes. Indeed, these pathways may be catalyzed by a limited number of isomerase, monooxygenase and dehydrogenase enzymes with broad substrate specificities. Glycine mediates the isomerization of cis-2-Methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienoic acid to trans-2-Methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienoic acid.

    "description": "During the production of the pesticide Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)), about 85% of the product consisted of isomers such as alpha-, beta- and delta-HCH. They were discarded into the environment, causing serious soil pollution. Aerobic biodegradation mineralizes alpha-, gamma-, and delta-HCH, whereas beta-HCH persists. Therefore, the degradation of beta-HCH and the other isomers was studied under anaerobic conditions by Peter Middeldorp (Environmental Science and Technology (1996) 30(7):2345-2349), in order to develop an anaerobic soil treatment process. beta-HCH was found to anaerobically biodegrade to benzene and chlorobenzene, both of which can undergo further degradation aerobically. The pathway from beta-HCH to benzene and chlorobenzene is the first anaerobic pathway in the EAWAG-BBD. This pathway can be carried out by a Dehalobacter sp. in coculture with a Sedimentibacter sp. ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16329975|van Doesburg et al., 2005]). A second, aerobic, beta-HCH metabolic pathway is mediated by haloalkane dehalogenase LinB in Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26. The stereochemistry of the 2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohexanol has not been determined; the stereoisomer shown is based on beta-HCH. The pentachlorocyclohexane is not further metabolized ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15812056|Nagata et al., 2004]).

Because of its high toxicity and persistence in soil, the use of g-HCH has been prohibited in many countries. g-HCH is degraded rapidly under anaerobic conditions, but is considered extremely persistent in upland soil. Sphingomonas (formerly Pseudomonas) paucimobilis SS86 was isolated from an upland experimental field to which g-HCH was applied once a year for twelve years.

Creosote is a less refined petrochemical mixture containing cresol. It is used as a fungicide and a wood preservative for railroad ties, telephone poles, and marine pilings. Despite their chemical similarity, cresol isomers are degraded by bacteria through different pathways.

It is used in food processing, including the extraction of vegetable oils, and as a solvent in various products and processes. In the atmosphere, the half-life of n-Hexane is estimated to be less than 2 days. The available data suggest that the acute toxicity of n-Hexane is low. Single exposures to n-Hexane can cause vertigo, giddiness, and drowsiness. n-Hexane is a mild skin irritant that causes transient erythema when in short-term contact with skin; it can also irritate the eyes. Chronic high level n-Hexane exposure damages the nervous system, initially producing a lack of feeling in the extremities and possibly progressing to a more severe nerve damage. The anaerobic biodegradation of n-Hexane starts by addition of fumate, similar to the anerobic toluene pathway.

The engine fuel antiknocking properties of an isomer of n-octane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane or isooctane) are used as a comparative standard in the Octane Rating System. Many microorganisms, including several Pseudomonads, are able to use linear alkanes as their sole source of carbon and energy ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7532480|Beilen et al., 1994]). The OCT-plasmid of Pseudomonas oleovorans contains two operons, alkBFGHJKL and alkST, which encode all proteins necessary for the degradation of n-octane and other five- to twelve-carbon linear alkanes ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7532480|Beilen et al., 1994]). Branched isomers, such as isooctane, are less susceptible to biodegradation than n-octane ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/539824|Schaeffer et al., 1979]). The conversion of n-octane to 1-octanol is catalyzed by a group of proteins collectively referred to as the \"alkane hydroxylase system.\" It has three main components: alkane 1-monooxygenase, and the two soluble proteins rubredoxin, and rubredoxin reductase. Rubredoxin reductase transfers electrons from NADH to rubredoxin. This protein then passes electrons to alkane 1-monoxygenase, an enzyme localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. The final product of this pathway, octanoyl-CoA, enters the beta-oxidation cycle and is used as both a carbon and energy source ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7532480|Beilen et al., 1994]).
