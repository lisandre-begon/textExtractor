The increasing use of plastics globally has generated serious environmental and 
human health problems, particularly in the agricultural sector where low-density 
polyethylene (LDPE) and other plastics are widely used. Due to its low recycling 
rate  and  slow  degradation  process,  LDPE  is  a  major  source  of  pollution.  This 
paper addresses the problem of plastic accumulation in agriculture, focusing on 
LDPE biodegradation strategies. The studies reviewed include recent data and the 
methodologies used include state-of-the-art technologies and others that have 
been used for decades, to monitor and measure the degree of biodegradation that 
each treatment applied can have, including SEM, GCMS, HPLC, and microscopy. 
The countries investigating these biodegradation methodologies are identified, 
and while some countries have been developing them for some years, others have 
only begun to address this problem in recent years. The use of microorganisms 
such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and insect larvae that influence its decomposition 
is highlighted. A workflow is proposed to carry out this type of research. Despite 
the advances, challenges remain, such as optimizing environmental conditions to 
accelerate the process and the need for further research that delves into microbial 
interactions in various environmental contexts.

1 Introduction

Plastic  production  worldwide  has  increased  since  1950,  the  time  when  large-scale 
production  started,  reaching  more  than  368  million  tons  reported  in  2019  and  2020 
(Ekanayaka et al., 2022; Plastics-Europe, 2021; Temporiti et al., 2022). Global consumption of 
plastics will continue to increase, so much so that by 2050 it is estimated that there will be up 
to 5.3 gigatons of plastics discarded in the environment (Schwarz et al., 2023). More than 90% 
of discarded plastic is not pretreated and goes into the sea and landfills (UNDP, 2023). This 
accumulation is evidenced by macro and microplastics, representing an environmental and 
public health problem, with high accumulation capacity in different ecosystems. This affects 
agricultural and livestock development and human health, causing various pathologies and in 
some cases even the death of different living beings (Hale et al., 2020; Skariyachan et al., 2021; 
Yee et al., 2021; Welden, 2020). Most of these materials are non-biodegradable, highly efficient,

and versatile, exhibiting a range of applications, due to their distinctive 
physical,  chemical,  mechanical,  and  thermal  properties  with  high 
resistance  to  atmospheric  and  corrosive  agents,  obtained  from 
petroleum derivatives and other hydrocarbons (Ali et al., 2018). The 
most  widely  applied  and  therefore  the  main  plastic  wastes  are 
low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 
polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET),  polypropylene  (PP),  polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS) (Temporiti et al., 2022; Lear 
et al., 2021; Matjašič et al., 2021; Zeghal et al., 2021). After their use, 
plastics become solid waste, which depending on the treatment in 
each country can follow three processes: recycling, incineration as a 
source of energy, or accumulation in landfills (Temporiti et al., 2022; 
Lear et al., 2021; Buchholz et al., 2022). When accumulated, these 
wastes  require  long  periods  for  their  natural  degradation.  The 
condition associated with the inherent characteristics of the plastic, 
such as high molecular weight, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, and the 
additives used to improve the quality of the final product, favoring 
resistance to atmospheric and corrosive agents (Temporiti et al., 2022; 
Lear et al., 2021; Matjašič et al., 2021; Harshvardhan and Jha, 2013).

Modern agriculture in some countries of the world has become 
dependent on single-use and extended-use plastic products for crop 
production. These materials have facilitated increased productivity 
and efficiency in agriculture (Lakhiar et al., 2024). The most frequent 
uses of plastics are oriented to soil covering, greenhouses, irrigation 
systems, seed germination, production, and packaging of products 
(Hofmann et al., 2023). The massive use of these polymers has been 
generating  several  environmental  problems  because  they  take 
hundreds of years to degrade; this problem is aggravated by the low 
recycling rate of agricultural plastics, partly due to contamination with 
soil, crop residues, and agricultural chemicals (Lakhiar et al., 2024; 
Hofmann  et  al.,  2023;  Correa-Cano  et  al.,  2023).  The  proper 
management of these wastes is related to Sustainable Development 
Goals 3, 12, and 15 (FAO, 2023).

In the search for green alternatives for managing plastic waste, 
biodegradation mechanisms are highlighted as a possible solution to 
mitigate this problem, particularly in the agricultural context. This 
biodegradation mechanism is a physicochemical and biological process 
mediated by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and other 
organisms or substances of biological origin (Koh and Khor, et al., 
2022; Jacquin et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2020). The biodegradation 
mecanism  has  four  main  stages  (see  Figure  1):  biodeterioration 
(colonization),  biofragmentation,  assimilation,  and  mineralization 
(Lucas et al., 2008), each influenced by a combination of environmental 
and microbial factors. In the biodeterioration phase, abiotic conditions 
such as temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and mechanical forces 
weaken  the  polymer  matrix,  creating  favorable  sites  for  microbial 
colonization  (Nag  et  al.,  2021;  Islami  et  al.,  2019;  Chaudhary 
et al., 2021).

Since plastisphere, as plastics have come to be called on the planet, 
linger in nature after disposal, causing damage with consequences for 
wildlife and human life (Žuna Pfeiffer et al., 2022). Furthermore, being 
a  developing  research  topic,  methodologies  for  biodegrading  and 
measuring  the  biodegradation  of  these  plastics  are  still  under 
investigation. This  review  article  examines  various  organisms  and 
methods employed in the biodegradation of plastics, with a particular 
focus on LDPE due to its widespread use in agriculture. Differences 
and  similarities  between  methods  are  discussed,  elucidating 
procedures that allow biodegradation to be measured accurately and 
reproducibly. In addition, the review discusses the challenges and 

implementation  of  these 
opportunities  associated  with  the 
technologies in agriculture and reviews the organisms used for this 
purpose. The analysis presented in this manuscript can contribute to 
the development of a more sustainable and resilient agriculture in the 
face of global environmental challenges.

The term “plastisphere,” coined to describe the accumulation of 
plastics in the environment, has gained prominence in recent years. 
These persistent pollutants, often referred to as “plastics” on Earth, have 
been linked to adverse effects on wildlife and human health (Žuna 
Pfeiffer et al., 2022). Moreover, as this is a developing research area, 
these plastics’ biodegradation and measurement methodologies are still 
under investigation. This is the pioneering study to explore this topic. 
For Peru that examines the various organisms and methods utilized in 
the biodegradation of plastics, with a particular focus on LDPE due to 
its  pervasive  usage  in  agricultural  applications,  and  discusses  the 
differences  and  similarities  between  methods  and  procedures  to 
accurately  and  reproducibly  measure  LDPE  biodegradation. 
Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges and opportunities 
associated with the implementation of these technologies in agriculture, 
as well as the organisms utilized for this purpose. The analysis presented 
in this manuscript can contribute to the awareness of the responsible 
use of plastics in the agricultural sector, to generate more sustainable 
and  resilient  agriculture  in  the  context  of  global  environmental 
challenges, while always prioritizing the welfare of human health.

2 Literature retrieval

The  bibliographic  review  began  with  the  search  protocol, 
establishing the terms and criteria. The databases selected were: Scopus, 
Nature, Web of Science, and the Google Scholar search engine due to 
their recognition and high impact (Zárate-Rueda et al., 2021). The 
search equation [“Biodegradation” OR “Biological degradation” OR 
“Biomineralization” AND (“Low-density polyethylene OR LDPE”)] 
was applied and the filters of the scientific tools were used with the 
application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria 
were keywords such as “Polyethylene” and “Biodegradation,” in original 
research articles and conference papers, published in the period from 
2019 to 2024, in the English language. Subsequently, a review of article 
titles and abstracts was performed. A total of 118 articles were obtained, 
of these 116 original research articles and 2 conference articles. Those 
articles  that  aligned  with  the  objectives  of  the  present  study  were 
selected and managed in the free license software Mendeley desktop 
v1.19.8. These were downloaded, analyzed, and diagrammed using 
computer tools such as Microsoft Excel, Word, QGis, VOSviewer, and 
Python as programming languages through the: Os, Pandas, Matplotlib, 
Seaborn,  WordCloud,  and  PyPDF2  libraries.  To  generate  the 
distribution map of the studies that are part of the analysis of this 
manuscript, information on the year of publication, country of the 
institution of the first author was used, the base shape of the map was 
downloaded from the UN page and worked in the QGis v2.0.2 tool. 
Then the extracted information from the papers was analyzed and 
diagrammed, and finally, a work flowchart was proposed.

agriculture are presented in Figure 2. The data indicate a significant 
concentration  of  studies  in  Asia,  particularly  in  China  and  India, 
which together account for 68 studies; these countries with the highest 
number of research also stand out for their substantial production of 
plastics. Between May 2021 to May 2024 alone, China produced 6.52 
million metric tons of plastic products (Statista, 2024a). Similar is the 
case  with  India,  which  in  2022  produced  a  volume  of  1.7  million 
metric tons of plastics (Statista, 2024b). Continents such as Oceania 
and South America present few studies related to the subject, while 
Oceania presents only one study during the period analyzed. This 
disparity  highlights  the  low  commitment  to  research  on  the 
biodegradation  of  plastics  and  underlines  the  need  for  a  broader 
commitment  to  address  plastic  pollution  fully.  In  Europe,  a  more 
balanced distribution of studies is observed, with countries such as 
Germany, Spain, and the UK contributing notably (Figure 2). This 
trend may be related to stringent environmental policies and research 
funding in the European Union, which promotes sustainable solutions 
for plastic waste management. In Canada, research activity is evident, 
aligning with its national policies to reduce plastic waste and promote 
a circular economy (CEPA, 1999). In addition, the map in Figure 2 
reveals a growing contribution from developing countries, particularly 
in Africa and Latin America. In this case, countries such as Brazil and 
South  Africa  are  beginning  to  emerge  in  the  field  of  plastic 
biodegradation research, possibly driven by the need to manage large 
amounts  of  plastic  waste  and  the  implementation  of  stricter 
environmental policies; they also receive foreign funding as part of 
biodiversity conservation efforts driven by plastic-producing countries.
The uneven distribution of research also reflects differences in the 
technological capacity and resources available for research in different 

regions. While developed countries have access to more funding and 
advanced technologies (Hsu et al., 2022), developing countries face 
challenges related to infrastructure and funding, which limits their 
ability to conduct high-quality research (Orona-Návar et al., 2022). In 
this  context,  it  is  essential  to  continue  fostering  international 
collaboration to share knowledge and strengthen human talent and 
technologies that can accelerate progress in plastics biodegradation 
research. Cooperative programs and joint funding can help to balance 
regional management inequalities and promote global solutions to 
plastic pollution.

2.2 Keywords

The graph generated in VOSviewer represents a co-occurrence 
map of terms used in titles and keywords related to the biodegradation 
of LDPE and other plastics in articles published between 2019 and 
2024. The largest and most central nodes, such as “Biodegradation,” 
“Polyethylene” and “LDPE,” indicate that these terms are the most 
mentioned  and  relevant  in  the  analyzed  articles.  The  connections 
between  the  nodes  reflect  the  frequency  with  which  these  terms 
in  the  same  studies,  suggesting  a  strong 
appear  together 
interrelationship between the concepts. Likewise, terms in the green 
cluster, such as “FTIR,” “GC–MS,” “SEM” and “Fungi,” indicate a focus 
on  analytical 
techniques  and  organisms  associated  with 
biodegradation. Their prominence is related to methodologies used to 
assess plastic degradation after various treatments. The blue cluster, 
which includes terms such as “Microplastics,” “Polypropylene” and 
“Isolated,” highlights research focused on the degradation of different

plastics and microorganisms. The pink group, which contains terms 
such  as  “Polystyrene,”  “Tenebrio  molitor”  and  “Depolymerization,” 
reflects an interest in the degradation of specific plastics and associated 
degradation mechanisms (Figure 3).

3 Industrial biodegradation

Industrial biodegradation offers a critical solution for managing 
polyethylene  (PE)  waste  by  utilizing  controlled  environments  to 
optimize the activity of microbial consortia and enzymatic systems. 
This approach capitalizes on advanced methodologies to address the 
limitations  of  natural  biodegradation  in  uncontrolled  settings. 
Constant  developments  highlight  the  use  of  enzyme-facilitated 
processes,  such  as  those  employing  oxidoreductases  and  laccases, 
which break down complex polymers into simpler, more manageable 
from  marine 
compounds.  These  enzymes,  often  derived 
microorganisms,  exhibit  remarkable  stability  under  industrial 
conditions, including variable temperatures, pH, and salinity, making 
them highly suitable for large-scale applications (Ayilara and Babalola, 
2023; Sivaperumal et al., 2017). Additionally, specialized bioreactors 
have been developed to enhance microbial activity, ensuring consistent 
degradation rates and efficient conversion of plastic into non-toxic 
byproducts, such as carbon dioxide and water (Verma and Jaiswal, 
2016).  The  effectiveness  of  industrial  biodegradation  is  further 
amplified  by  leveraging  microbial  consortia  capable  of  synergistic 
actions. Bacterial and fungal strains have demonstrated the ability to 
depolymerize  PE  and  similar  materials,  transforming  them  into 
oligomers that are subsequently mineralized. The controlled nature of 

industrial processes also allows for the use of genetically modified 
organisms, tailored to target specific types of plastic waste, thereby 
maximizing  efficiency  and  minimizing  residual  contamination. 
Moreover,  advancements  in  bioprocess  technology,  including  the 
integration  of  co-metabolism  strategies,  have  shown  significant 
promise in enhancing degradation rates, particularly for recalcitrant 
plastics (Rüthi et al., 2023).

consistently  every  year,  reflecting  their  sustained  effectiveness  in 
plastic  biodegradation.  Fungi,  although  less  frequent,  have  shown 
intermittent use, while microbial consortia, which combine bacteria 
and fungi, have recently gained interest because they combine the 
metabolic  capabilities  of  several  species  to  achieve  more  efficient 
biodegradation. These consortia can produce complementary enzymes 
that  fragment  plastic  polymers  faster  and  more  effectively  than 
individual microorganisms. Their ability to form biofilms improves the 
adhesion and decomposition of plastics, especially when their activity 
is stimulated with oxidizing agents such as H2O2, which enhances the 
production of key enzymes such as peroxidases (Skariyachan et al., 
2021; Fachrul et al., 2024; Mohammadi et al., 2022) On the other hand, 
larvae have been occasionally employed, highlighting their potential 
in certain specific contexts (He et al., 2024; Burd et al., 2023; Yang et al., 
2021) and algae (Sanniyasi et al., 2021) which represent an innovative 
strategy in LDPE biodegradation have also been used sporadically. 
This  temporal  distribution  highlights  the  diversification  of  the 
methodologies  applied  to  biodegradation  in  recent  years,  with  an 
increasing trend toward the use of microbial combinations, as well as 
the exploration of new degraders such as larvae and algae.

Studies on LDPE biodegradation demonstrate varying efficiencies 
depending on the organism and conditions. Weight loss percentages 
range from 1.50 to 88.50%, with Zophobas atratus larvae achieving the 
highest reduction (88.50% in 45 days) (Wang et al., 2022). Fungi such 
as Aspergillus niger (Sáenz et al., 2019), and bacteria like Alcaligenes 
faecalis (Nag et al., 2021), also show promising results, with weight loss 
exceeding 20% in specific setups. These results highlight the diverse 
potential of biological agents in plastic degradation and the differences 
in percentages of weight loss (Table 3).

Each type of organism has unique degradation capabilities that are 
influenced  by  its  origin,  environmental  conditions,  and  previous 
treatments. Table 4 presents some advantages and disadvantages of the 
different organisms in the process of biodegradation of plastics. In the 
case of degrading bacteria, they commonly belong to genera such as 
Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus. Pseudomonas 
putida (Li et al., 2024), is known for its ability to degrade polyesters, 
whereas Bacillus subtilis (Kumar Gupta and Devi, 2019), has shown 
successful  degradation  of  polystyrene.  Fungi  have  a  significant 
advantage due to their ability to secrete large amounts of enzymes 
such as; peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase enzymes outside their cells, 
which allows the degradation of complex polymers in the immediate 
environment  (Wang  et  al.,  2019);  this  characteristic  has  enabled 
multiple assays in plastic degradation. One example is Rhodotorula 
mucilaginosa, a fungus isolated from marine sediments.

In recent studies, this fungus was exposed to polyethylene treated 
with  ultraviolet  (UV)  radiation,  a  pretreatment  that  favors  plastic 
biodegradation (Giyahchi and Moghimi, 2023). Therefore, the ability 
of fungi to degrade plastics is not limited to only R. mucilaginosa 
species,  but  also  to  other  fungi,  such  as  the  genera  Aspergillus, 
Penicillium, and Fusarium, as they have also shown potential in the 
biodegradation of different types of plastics. For example, Aspergillus 
niger (Fachrul et al., 2024), has been reported for its ability to degrade 
polyurethane, while Penicillium chrysogenum (Khan et al., 2023), and 
Fusarium solani (Wróbel et al., 2023), have shown effectiveness in the 
degradation  of  polyethylene 
and  polypropylene.  Certain 
microorganisms  can  produce  compounds  that  facilitate  the 
decomposition of plastic by other organisms in the consortium, this 
is due to the release of compounds such as organic acids, peroxides, 
and  other  secondary  metabolites  (Tiwari  et  al.,  2024;  Wang  et  al., 
2023), which modify the structure of the plastic and make it more 
susceptible to enzymatic degradation.

As for the enzymes, laccase, peroxidase, and cutinase (Gao et al., 
2022;  Tamnou  et  al.,  2022),  are  some  of  the  most  studied  in  this 
context.  These  enzymes  can  break  the  chemical  bonds  of  plastic 
polymers, facilitating their decomposition into monomers and other 
simpler compounds, such as carbon and carbon dioxide (CO2). Often, 
this material is integrated into the organism as part of its carbon 
source. However, the production of these enzymes may be limited by 
factors  such  as  nutrient  availability,  pH,  temperature,  and  the 
presence of specific inducers, such as plastid-related substrates and 
cofactors necessary for enzymatic activity (Khandare et al., 2022; Li 
et al., 2023).

The biodegradation of plastics using larvae has emerged as a novel 
and  promising  approach.  Various  insect  species,  in  particular  the 
larvae of certain beetles and flies, have demonstrated the ability to 
degrade plastics through their digestive processes. This approach not

only offers an environmentally friendly alternative for plastic waste 
management but can also be integrated with sustainable agricultural 
practices.  One  documented  case  is  the  beetle  Tenebrio  molitor, 
commonly known as the mealworm. Larvae of T. molitor can degrade 
plastics such as PS and PE (Wang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). This 
process is facilitated by the presence of symbiotic microorganisms in 
the larval digestive system, which produces enzymes such as alkane 
monooxygenase (Zaman et al., 2024), and laccase (Kundungal et al., 

2021), that are capable of breaking down these polymers into smaller 
carbon chains and sometimes into CO2 and water. T. molitor larvae 
can consume approximately 34–39 mg of EPS, a plastic widely used in 
containers  and  packaging  (Wang  et  al.,  2022).  As  a  result,  EPS  is 
oxidized and fragmented, with a significant reduction in its molecular 
weight. However, many times plastic can be integrated into the same 
organism of larvae in the form of microplastics and nanoplastics, and 
although it may seem insignificant this can be a problem since the end

Larvae

H. illucens are known for their ability to break down organic matter 
and have been studied for their ability to degrade bioplastics such as 
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and polylactate (PLA), breaking down 
PLA into simpler compounds such as lactic acid and CO2 (Wang et al., 
2024). Therefore, this helps us to understand that the efficiency of 
larvae in biodegrading plastics is enhanced by the synergy between 
insects  and  the  microorganisms  present  in  their  gut.  Symbiotic 
bacteria and fungi produce a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, such as 
esterase, cutinase, and lipase, which are essential for the degradation 
of plastic polymers. In addition, the mechanical action of chewing and 
the intestinal movement of the larvae facilitates the fragmentation of 
the plastic, increasing the surface area exposed to enzymatic action, 
this process although not a decomposition is an important part of 
subsequent biodegradation processes (Ma et al., 2023).

The  integration  of  plastic-degrading  larvae  in  agricultural 
systems has multiple benefits. Not only does it contribute to reducing 
plastic waste in the agricultural environment, but it also produces 
valuable by-products such as frass, the so-called “insect excrement,” 
which  can  be  used  as  an  organic  fertilizer.  The  resulting  frass  is 
applied to crops as fertilizer, and although the mature larvae can 
be fed for poultry or fish, creating a more sustainable and circular 
agricultural system, (Peng et al., 2022). However, the effect of possible 
micro  and  nano  plastics  on  larvae  should  be  studied  in  detail. 
Therefore,  an  integrated  system  model  in  on-farm  plastic  waste 
management  could  include  the  use  of  T.  molitor  larvae,  where 
agricultural  plastics  such  as  PE  mulch  can  be  degraded  in  situ. 
Despite the promising potential, using larvae for biodegradation of 
plastics faces several challenges. One of the main ones is optimizing 
culture conditions to maximize degradation efficiency. In addition, it 
is necessary to ensure that micro-and nanoplastics do not enter the 
food chain, due to their negative effects such as drug resistance and 
new diseases (Shi et al., 2024).

Supplementary Figure S2 presents a comparative analysis of the 
average evaluation time for different organisms or substances used in 
the  biodegradation  of  polyethylene.  A  great  variability  in  the 
evaluation times is observed, which reflects both the diversity of the 
organisms studied and the complexity of the biodegradation processes. 
Some microorganisms such as Brevibacillus brevis (Tiwari et al., 2023), 
and the soil microbiome (Ma et al., 2023; Jayan et al., 2023; Maddison 
et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), 
stand  out  as  having  significantly  long  evaluation  times,  exceeding 
450 days. This suggests that these microorganisms may have a slow 
biodegradation process, or that studies conducted with them have 
required a prolonged time to observe significant results. In contrast, 
the  fungus  Rhizopus  sp.  (Gupta  and  Devi,  2020),  and  the  beetle 
Zophobas atratus (He et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2021; Lou et al., 2021; 
Sanluis-Verdes et al., 2022), show evaluation times in the range of 
20–60 days, which could indicate higher biodegradation efficiency or 
studies designed for faster results. Different strains of Z. atratus and 
their combinations with other organisms such as Tenebrio molitor 
show a wide range of evaluation times, suggesting that the interaction 
between  species  and  the  specificity  of  the  organisms  used  have  a 
significant impact on biodegradation efficiency and the conditions 
they require.

of these larvae can be food for other larger organisms and indirectly 
can expand and integrate into their organism (Yang et al., 2021).

Another species, that has shown potential in the biodegradation 
of plastics, is the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens). The larvae of 

Another notable aspect is the case of the bacterium  Gordonia 
polyisoprenivorans  (Wang  et  al.,  2023),  which  has  an  intermediate 
evaluation time, which could be related to its specialized capabilities 
in the degradation of complex polymers but requires considerable

time to demonstrate its effectiveness. The use of microbial consortia, 
such as Bacterial-Fungal Consortium (BFC) (Li et al., 2024; Adithama 
et al., 2023; Bao et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023), seems to offer a robust 
strategy,  with  more  efficient  assessment  times  compared  to  some 
individual  microorganisms,  suggesting  that  cooperation  between 
different types of microorganisms could accelerate the biodegradation 
process,  so  the  outlook  for  such  studies  is  encouraging,  although 
interactions  between  different  taxonomic  groups  could  result  in 
antagonism and competition, requiring careful observations to create 
partnerships that can work successfully. A deducible rule of thumb is 
that more specialized organisms, such as certain fungi and bacteria, 
tend to require less time for evaluation, whereas microbial consortia 
and microorganisms working in more complex environments may 
need longer times to show results. However, this may also indicate 
that, in the future, the development of optimized consortia and genetic 
engineering techniques could significantly reduce these times, making 
biodegradation faster and more efficient. It is worth mentioning that 
for  practicality  a  single  study  that  evaluated  Soil  microbiome  and 
climatic  conditions  for  2,556 days  was  not  represented 
in 
Supplementary Figure S2, more details in Supplementary Table S1.

5 Aspects of LDPE in biodegradation 
processes

5.1 Mechanism of biodegradation

Microorganisms,  including  bacteria  and  fungi,  attach  to  the 
polymer  surface  using  biofilm-forming  mechanisms  and  secrete 
compounds  like  exopolysaccharides  and  surfactants  to  further 
degrade  the  structure  (Sáenz  et  al.,  2019;  Elsamahy  et  al.,  2023). 
During biofragmentation, extracellular enzymes such as hydrolases, 
laccases, and esterases break down long polymer chains into smaller 
oligomers and monomers (Li et al., 2024). The efficiency of this stage 
depends  on 
the  chemical  composition,  crystallinity,  and 
hydrophobicity of the polymers, as well as the availability of cofactors 
like oxygen and nutrients. Once fragmented, the smaller compounds 
are taken up by microbial cells in the assimilation stage, where they 
undergo intracellular metabolic processes to produce energy, biomass, 
and intermediate metabolites (He et al., 2024). Factors like microbial 
metabolic diversity, the availability of electron donors and acceptors, 
and community interactions significantly influence this stage (Sunny 
and  Saleena,  2020).  The  final  phase,  mineralization,  involves  the 
complete degradation of organic matter into inorganic molecules such 
as carbon dioxide, water, and methane (El-Sayed et al., 2021; Zahari 
et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2023). This stage is heavily influenced by 
environmental parameters, including pH, redox potential, and oxygen 
availability, which dictate whether the process occurs under aerobic 
or anaerobic conditions (Obaid and AL-Jawhari, 2023). In addition to 
these environmental factors, microbial interactions play a critical role 
in enhancing biodegradation efficiency. Cooperative relationships, 
such  as  cross-feeding  and  enzyme  complementation,  improve 
substrate  utilization,  while  competitive  interactions  can  reduce 
efficiency  by  limiting  resource  availability  (Pinto  et  al.,  2022). 
Operational  parameters,  such  as  temperature,  moisture  content, 
agitation,  and  nutrient  supplementation,  are  also  key  drivers  of 
biodegradation outcomes. These factors, extensively studied in the 
literature, underline the complexity of the process, demonstrating how 

microbial and environmental conditions synergistically dictate the 
transformation  of  polymers  into  simpler,  environmentally  benign 
products, such as carbon dioxide, water, and biomass (Temporiti et al., 
2022; Thomas Zumstein et al., 2018; He et al., 2024; Figure 1).

5.2 Parameters affecting biodegradation 
efficiency

and 

operating 

The  parameters  influencing  biodegradation  efficiency  in  the 
reviewed studies are diverse and often interdependent, highlighting 
the  complexity  of  this  process.  Key  variables  include  microbial 
substrate-specific 
conditions, 
interactions, 
characteristics. For instance, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa demonstrated 
varied efficiency depending on the UV pre-treatment duration and 
the addition of 13C-PE as a sole carbon source (Vaksmaa et al., 2023). 
Similarly, the inclusion of enriched media, such as mineral salt broth 
inoculated  with  Gordonia  polyisoprenivorans,  enhanced  LDPE 
degradation over 35 days, emphasizing the role of nutrient availability 
and sterilization methods (Tiwari et al., 2023) incorporating microbial 
licheniformis  and  Achromobacter 
consortia,  such  as  Bacillus 
xylosoxidans,  further  underscore  the  significance  of  synergistic 
microbial interactions, which enhance degradation pathways (Fachrul 
et  al.,  2024).  Environmental  conditions  also  critically  impact 
biodegradation  outcomes.  Temperature,  pH,  and  agitation 
significantly influenced results, as seen with Bacillus subtilis, which 
required optimized incubation parameters to achieve notable LDPE 
degradation (Mohammadi et al., 2022). Furthermore, pre-treatment 
processes,  such  as  UV  irradiation  or  chemical  oxidation,  were 
consistently noted to enhance microbial attachment and enzymatic 
activity, as demonstrated in Microbulbifer hydrolyticus experiments 
with  LLDPE  particles  (Li  et  al.,  2020),  in  the  S1  the  columns 
“Organism  or  substance  and  its  origin,”  “Type  of  degrader,” 
“Pre-treatment  condition  and  initial  size,”  “Treatments,”  and 
“Evaluation Time” can give an extent analysis about this point.

5.3 Forms of LDPE undergoing 
biodegradation

In LDPE biodegradation studies, the physical form of the plastic 
plays  an  important  role  in  the  interaction  with  the  degrading 
organisms. The different presentations of the plastic, such as films, 
powder,  sheets,  beads,  granules,  and  foams,  among  others 
(Supplementary  Table  S2),  affect  the  surface  area  available  for 
adhesion and subsequent degradation. In the publications analyzed, 
46% used plastics in the form of films (Supplementary Figure S3), this 
form offers a larger surface area in contact, which favors adhesion and 
colonization (Skariyachan et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Jeon et al., 
2021; Kong et al., 2024; Puglisi et al., 2019). Their advantage lies in 
their similarity to agricultural plastics, such as mulching films, making 
them relevant models in these studies. Their disadvantage is their 
thickness and low resistance to aggressive pretreatment, which may 
disintegrate  them  before  completing  biodegradation.  The  plastic 
powder was 18.4%, and the reduced particle size positively influences 
the rapid interaction with microorganisms (Tiwari et al., 2023; Bernat 
et al., 2023; Montazer et al., 2021; Pathak and Navneet, 2023; Yang 
et al., 2022). Their limitation is the additional mechanical pretreatment

Mendoza et al.

for their production, hindering complexity in the practical application 
of the biodegradation process in the agricultural sector. 16.1% report 
the  use  of  sheets,  which  are  more  manageable  and  have  greater 
durability compared to pretreatments. In some cases, they may take 
longer to degrade due to their thickness (Pinto et al., 2022; Zaman 
et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2023; Hou et al., 2022; Joshi et al., 2022; Mishra 
et al., 2024), Bags with 6.9% represent a high surface-to-volume ratio, 
which favors biodegradation. The main difficulty of this form is the 
uniformity  of  the  experimental  conditions  and  their  respective 
comparisons with other studies, taking into account the different sizes 
and thicknesses (Jayan et al., 2023; Gerritse et al., 2020; Mohy Eldin 
et al., 2022; Nademo et al., 2023; Nnaji et al., 2021; Poma et al., 2022) 
LDPE foams with 5.75% present a porous structure that increases the 
interaction  with  microorganisms,  allowing  better  penetration  of 
nutrients and microbial enzymes, and accelerating the biodegradation 
process. Its limitation is the difficulty of the precise quantification of 
the degraded material (Yang et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2022; Lou et al., 
2021; Wang et al., 2022), Granules (4.6%) and beads (2.3%), being 
more  compact  in  shape,  reducing  the  surface  area  available  for 
microbial colonization, reducing biodegradation efficiency. However, 
as they are easy to manipulate and quantify, they are useful in small-
scale studies (Khandare et al., 2022; Adithama et al., 2023; Dey et al., 
2020; Kunlere et al., 2019; Zadjelovic et al., 2022).

5.4 Pretreatment of LDPE under 
biodegradation

Most  studies  report  the  pretreatment  of  the  plastic  in  the 
biodegradation  process,  taking  into  account  that  this  increases  its 
susceptibility to microbial degradation. One of the most common 
treatments  is  exposure  to  UV  radiation,  a  process  that  partially 
degrades the plastic, facilitating its decomposition by modifying its 
physical and chemical properties (Yuan et al., 2023; Chaudhary et al., 
2023; Min et al., 2020; Montazer et al., 2020). To mention an example, 
LDPE treated with UV radiation for 48 h develops carbonyl groups 
and peroxides on its surface, which enhances the adhesion and activity 
of bacteria isolated from landfills, resulting in higher production of 
degrading enzymes and a higher biodegradation rate compared to 
untreated plastics (Soleimani et al., 2021). In the case of polyester, 
chemical treatment with nitric acid facilitates its decomposition by 
bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Culture conditions also play a key 
role in biodegradation, as factors such as optimum temperature (30°C 
for HDPE), pH (7.0 for polystyrene), and the availability of nutrients, 
such as glucose, influence microbial activity (Ji et al., 2023).

5.5 Growing conditions

By using plastic as the sole or main carbon source, a selective 
pressure is induced that forces the organism to consume the polymer, 
which  allows  observing  its  behavior  and  evolution  under  these 
challenging conditions. Culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, 
and nutrient availability, are critical factors affecting microbial activity 
and the efficiency of plastic biodegradation. Most studies maintain 
controlled  conditions  to  optimize  the  activity  of  the  degrading 
organisms, varying these conditions according to the type of organism 
and  plastic  to  be  degraded.  Aderiye  et  al.  (2019),  in  their  study 

published  in  2023  found  that  the  optimum  temperature  for  the 
biodegradation of HDPE by bacteria isolated from a waste landfill was 
30°C. On the other hand, Chaudhary et al. (2023), found that a pH of 
7 was optimal for the enzymatic activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens 
in the biodegradation of polystyrene. DSouza et al. (2021), showed 
that the addition of glucose in the experimental setups as an additional 
carbon source increased the rate of polypropylene biodegradation by 
Aspergillus niger. Oxygen concentration is another crucial factor that 
can influence the biodegradation of plastics. In one study, bacteria of 
the genus Bacillus were found to be more effective in the degradation 
of polyethylene under aerobic conditions, while bacteria of the genus 
Clostridium  showed  higher  efficiency  under  anaerobic  conditions 
(Islami et al., 2019; Fibriarti et al., 2021).

5.6 Limitations and considerations in the 
biodegradation of polyethylene in the 
agricultural system

Biodegradation of polyethylene in agricultural systems faces 
limitations  due  to  the  chemical  nature  of  this  polymer  and  the 
specific conditions of agricultural environments. PE, widely used 
in  agricultural  plastics  such  as  mulching  and  coverings,  has  a 
molecular  structure  with  highly  stable  carbon–carbon  bonds, 
which  makes  its  biological  decomposition  difficult  (Hou  et  al., 
2022).  In  these  systems,  soil  organisms,  such  as  larvae,  and 
microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria, must compete with 
other more accessible carbon sources, which reduces the metabolic 
priority of PE and slows down its biodegradation (Yang et al., 2021; 
Montazer et al., 2020). Environmental factors such as temperature, 
pH, humidity, and nutrient availability vary considerably in the 
soil,  limiting  the  enzymatic  activity  necessary  for  polymer 
decomposition (Montazer et al., 2020). In many cases, PE requires 
pretreatments  to  increase  its  bioavailability  to  microorganisms. 
Exposure  to  UV  radiation  or  the  use  of  oxidizing  agents  can 
partially break the polymer chains, increasing the susceptibility of 
the plastic to biodegradation (Yuan et al., 2023). However, these 
pretreatments  not  only  increase  operational  costs  but  can  also 
generate byproducts that alter soil microbial dynamics or negatively 
impact the quality of the agricultural ecosystem. Smaller fragments, 
such as microplastics generated by partial degradation of mulch, 
can be integrated into the soil, which presents a double challenge: 
on  the  one  hand,  they  increase  the  contact  surface  for 
microorganisms, but on the other, they pose ecological risks by 
being transported to other parts of the ecosystem and incorporated 
into  food  chains.  Intermediate  products  generated  during 
biodegradation, such as low molecular weight compounds, must 
be  assessed  at  a  toxicological  level,  to  ensure  that  they  do  not 
interfere with soil health or crops (Nelson et al., 2022).

such as EDS and XPS are used to analyze elemental composition and 
chemical properties, while TGA and DSC evaluate the thermal stability 
of materials undergoing biodegradation. HPLC and GC–MS allow the 
identification of specific degradation products, such as organic acids 
and  complex  compounds,  while  the  use  of  XRD  and  PY-GC–MS

7 Considerations for control of 
biodegradation test results

To develop a consolidated methodology to maximize the efficiency 
of plastic biodegradation in agriculture, it is essential to consider several 
key factors: proper selection of degrading organisms, pretreatment of 
the plastic, and the use of accurate analytical techniques. A roadmap 
for the plastic biodegradation process is proposed in Figure 5. The 
selection of degrading organisms should be based on their ability to 
produce  specific  enzymes  that  can  degrade  the  type  of  plastic  in 
question. The combination of fungi and bacteria isolated from marine

and terrestrial environments is effective in many studies (Fachrul et al., 
2024; Wróbel et al., 2023; Mohy Eldin et al., 2022; Chigwada et al., 2023; 
Maheswaran et al., 2023). The use of microbial consortia, which include 
multiple  species  with  complementary  capabilities,  can  significantly 
improve biodegradation efficiency, or a specific strain or organism that 
needs  to  be  tested  as  a  plastic  biodegrader  must  also  be  chosen. 
Pretreatment of plastic, such as UV exposure, thermal oxidation, and 
chemical  treatment,  can  significantly  increase  its  susceptibility  to 
biodegradation. These treatments should be optimized for different 
types  of  plastics  and  experimental  conditions  to  maximize  their 
effectiveness. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of these 
pretreatments in combination with microbial biodegraders to develop 
integrated and efficient processes.

Culture  conditions  must  be  controlled  to  optimize  microbial 
activity and the production of degradative enzymes. Factors such as 
temperature, pH, nutrient availability, and oxygen concentration must 
be  adjusted  to  maximize  biodegradation  efficiency.  Continued 
research on optimizing these conditions for different microorganisms 
and  types  of  plastics  is  crucial.  The  use  of  advanced  analytical 
techniques  is  essential  to  assess  the  efficiency  and  extent  of 
biodegradation.  Techniques  such  as  GC  quadrupole  mass 
spectrometry, GC flame ionization detection, FTIR, and SEM should 
be used to analyze changes in the chemical structure and morphology 
of the plastic during biodegradation. Despite significant advances in 

LDPE  biodegradation,  several  areas  require  further  research  to 
improve the efficiency and applicability of these technologies. It is 
crucial  to  conduct  comprehensive  studies  on  the  environmental 
impact and economic feasibility of LDPE biodegradation processes on 
an industrial scale. This includes assessing the toxicity of degradation 
products  and  the  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of 
biodegradation technologies in different industrial contexts.

8 Perspectives in plastics 
biodegradation

The future of plastic biodegradation depends on the advancement of 
biotechnology, genetic engineering, and the implementation of sustainable 
solutions  on  a  large  scale.  It  is  not  enough  to  optimize  degradation 
processes; it is essential to design, develop, and apply more efficient and 
cost-effective  strategies  that  are  applicable  in  various  sectors  such  as 
agriculture, industry, and urban waste management. The application of 
genetically  improved  microorganisms  may  be  an  option  for  the 
development  of  more  efficient,  specific,  and  stable  enzymes  for  the 
degradation of polymers such as polyethylene. The immobilization of 
enzymes on solid supports offers opportunities for their reuse and for 
continuous biodegradation processes. Biodegradation could be integrated 
with physical–chemical recycling procedures, within a holistic circular

economy approach. Biodegradation derivatives, such as carbon dioxide, 
biomass,  and/or  recovered  monomers,  could  be  reused  as  inputs  in 
production  chains,  thus  ending  the  plastics  cycle.  For  plastic 
biodegradation to be implemented, obstacles related to production costs 
and government regulations must be overcome.

9 Final reflections

From this review, it is established that it is essential to consider 
several  measurements  to  assess  biodegradation,  covering  different 
aspects:  in  the  physical  area,  it  is  necessary  to  control  the  mass  by 
measuring the percentage of weight lost from the plastic, make direct 
observations using SEM to monitor physical changes, and evaluate the 
level of crystallinity using TGA; in the chemical aspect, it is essential to 
use chromatography techniques such as HPLC and GC–MS to identify 
and quantify new compounds generated during biodegradation; and in 
the  biological  area,  metabolic  tests  and  identification  of  metabolic 
pathways should be carried out, applying omics sciences to study the 
genes and enzymes involved, as well as the interactions that are crucial, 
especially in the case of larvae whose microbiome plays a key role in 
biodegradation,  since  it  was  observed  that  there  was  a  decrease  in 
degradation capacity when antibiotics were applied to the larvae before 
subjecting them to the plastic biodegradation test. On the other hand, it 
is also important to evaluate the long-term sustainability of the consortia 
when  trials  with  more  than  one  microorganism  are  proposed.  This 
integrated approach will allow a deeper and more accurate understanding 
of  the  biodegradation  process,  encompassing  both  the  physical  and 
chemical changes as well as the biological and microbial aspects involved.
According to the analysis of the methodologies currently used the 
most  used  organisms  in  recent  years  have  been  listed.  Despite  the 
progress made in the biodegradation of LDPE and other plastics used in 
everyday  life  including  agriculture,  fundamental  aspects  remain  to 
be explored. Current research has identified promising organisms and 
methods, but it is clear that more in-depth and diversified studies are 
required to fully understand microbial interactions and their effectiveness 
under different environmental conditions. In addition, the disparity in 
the geographic distribution of research suggests an urgent need for more 
inclusive  approaches  that  consider  the  global  applicability  of  these 
technologies, especially in regions with fragile ecosystems. Furthermore, 
studies on microplastics and nanoplastics, i.e., on material undergoing 
biodegradation, are essential, since their effects can still be harmful and 
further treatments must be found for their complete mineralization. 
Therefore, this work lays a solid foundation but also leaves open several 
questions  that  future  research  will  need  to  address  to  develop  more 
effective  biodegradable  solutions  adapted  to  various  contexts.  The 
remaining challenges include the need to deepen the understanding of 
the complex interactions between different microbial consortia, as well 
as their relationships with the environment, the enzymes involved, and 
their long-term efficacy under varying environmental conditions.
