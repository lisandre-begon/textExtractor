Route of degradation in soil A soil experiment on a sandy loam soil (pH 6.0, OC 2.5%, clay 10%) was carried out underaerobic conditions in the laboratory (20\u00b0C, 50% maximum water holding capacity (MWHC))in the dark. The formation of residues not extracted by several extraction steps were asignificant sink for the applied phenyl-UL- 14 C-radiolabelled 2-phenylphenol (80.0% or 77.4%of the applied radiolabel (AR) after 91 or 127 days, respectively). Mineralisation to carbondioxide of this radiolabel accounted for 8.4% AR after 91 days and 9.6% AR after 127 days.No extracted metabolite accounted for >2% AR at any sampling time.Data on anaerobic degradation or photolysis in soil were not available for 2-phenylphenol.However these data are not necessary to complete an assessment for the applied forrepresentative use, which is only an indoor application.4.1.2. Persistence of the active substance and their metabolites, degradation orreaction productsThe rate of degradation of 2-phenylphenol was estimated from the results of the studydescribed in section 4.1.1 above. The calculated DT 50 was 0.11 day (single first-order nonlinear regression, 20\u00b0C, 50% MWHC, n=1). After normalisation to FOCUS referenceconditions 4 (20\u00b0C and -10kPa soil moisture content) this value of single first-order DT50remained unchanged.Since contamination of soil is not expected from the applied for representative uses of 2-phenylphenol, the predicted environmental concentration in soil was not calculated.4.1.3. Mobility in soil of the active substance and their metabolites, degradation orreaction productsThe adsorption/desorption of 2-phenylphenol was investigated in four soils (pH 5.2 \u2013 7.3, OC1.9 \u2013 3.0%, clay 12.4 \u2013 30.1%) in batch adsorption experiments. In the preliminary tests ofthe study a strong adsorption of 2-phenylphenol to soil was observed, which continued over168 hours thus the equilibrium could not be reached within a reasonable time interval. Theadsorption and desorption times in the definitive test was therefore shortened to 1 or 4 hours.In these circumstances the calculated adsorption K foc values varied from 252 to 393 mL/g,(mean 347 mL/g) (1/n 0.784 \u2013 0.870, mean 0.82). The Kfoc values reflect the reversiblyadsorbed portion of 2-phenylphenol only with no equilibrium being reached after a shortincubation period, therefore they would represent a worst case if they were used for modellingthe leaching behaviour. There was no evidence of a correlation of adsorption with pH.",

    "input": "4. Environmental fate and behaviour Amitrole was discussed at the Pesticides Peer Review meeting 110 on environmental fate andbehaviour.In soil laboratory incubations under aerobic conditions in the dark, amitrole exhibited low to moderatepersistence. Transformation products accounting for > 5% applied radioactivity (AR) were not formed.Mineralisation of the 3- 14C radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 44 % AR after 91 days. Theformation of unextractable residues (not extracted by acidified ethanol / water followed by acidifiedmethanol / acetone / water) for this radiolabel accounted for 41 % AR after 91 days. Reliableanaerobic soil incubations were not available, this is identified as a data gap for the representative usesin territories where these soil conditions occur. In a laboratory photolysis study the transformationproduct 1,2,4-triazole accounted for 9.9% AR. This metabolite exhibited moderate to high persistencein soil exhibiting a biphasic pattern of decline8. Amitrole exhibited high to medium mobility in soil.The photolysis transformation product 1,2,4-triazole exhibited very high to high soil mobility7. It wasconcluded that the adsorption of amitrole and 1,2,4-triazole was not pH dependent. In satisfactory field dissipation studies carried out at 2 sites in the USA and 1 in the UK amitrole exhibited low tomoderate persistence. In European field dissipation studies at 4 sites where 1,2,4-triazole was dosed,this metabolite exhibited a biphasic pattern of decline having moderate to high persistence.7In laboratory incubations in dark aerobic natural sediment water systems, amitrole exhibited mediumpersistence, forming no major (>10% AR) transformation products. The unextractable sedimentfraction (not extracted by methanol) was the major sink for 3- 14C radiolabel, accounting for 26 \u201340 % AR at study end (91 days). Mineralisation to carbon dioxide of this radiolabel accounted for 10 \u201318 % AR at the end of the study. Amitrole was stable in a laboratory sterile aqueous photolysisexperiment.The surface water and sediment exposure assessments (Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC)calculations) were carried out for the identified soil photolysis metabolite 1,2,4-triazole, using theFOCUS (FOCUS, 2001) step 1 approach (version 1.1 of the Steps 1-2 in FOCUS calculator). For theactive substance amitrole, step 3 (FOCUS, 2001) and step 4 calculations were available for theFOCUS runoff scenarios9 for situations where a single application was made and one third of thesurface area of orchards or vineyards were treated. This was considered by the RMS and experts fromMember State competent authorities to represent a best case, as surveys of practice of non-selectiveherbicide use in orchards and vineyards in France indicated that between half and one third of thesurface areas are usually treated. For drainage scenarios at step 3 and 4 the available simulationserroneously included crop interception being estimated by MACRO. For this herbicide applicationwhere downward application is made to weeds / the soil this is not appropriate. The step 4 calculationsfor the runoff scenarios appropriately followed the FOCUS (FOCUS, 2007) guidance, with no-spraybuffer zones up to 40 m for streams (94.8 % spray drift reduction) and 100 m for ponds (86% spraydrift reduction) being combined with vegetative buffer strips of up to 20 m (reducing solute flux inrun-off by 80 % and erosion runoff by 95 %) being implemented. The SWAN tool (version 3.0.0) wasappropriately used to implement these mitigation measures in the simulations. However, risk managersand others may wish to note that whilst run-off mitigation is included in the step 4 calculationsavailable, the FOCUS (FOCUS, 2007) report acknowledges that for substances with KFoc < 2000 mL/g(i.e. amitrole), the general applicability and effectiveness of run-off mitigation measures had been lessclearly demonstrated in the available scientific literature, than for more strongly adsorbed compounds.Data gaps are identified for surface water exposure assessments for FOCUS drainage scenarios andmultiple (including split) application pattern GAPs as well as for situations where half the surface areaof an orchard or vineyard are treated. For the representative use on impermeable surfaces (roads) andpermeable surfaces (railways), PEC were calculated using the model HardSPEC 1.4.2 (Hollis et al,2003). This model was developed for UK climatic conditions and reflects UK civil engineeringspecifications. Its applicability to other territories in the EU is not known.Groundwater exposure assessments were carried out using FOCUS (FOCUS, 2009) scenarios and themodel PELMO 4.4.38 for the active substance amitrole and its soil photolysis metabolite 1,2,4 triazolefor the represented uses on crops. The simulations for 1,2,4-triazole followed FOCUS (FOCUS, 2006)kinetics guidance for implementing biphasic patterns of decline in FOCUS exposure modelling. Thismodelling assumed that one third of the surface area of orchards or vineyards were treated. Again thiswas considered by the RMS and experts from Member State competent authorities to represent a bestcase, for the same reasons already indicated above. The potential for groundwater exposure from theseuses by amitrole above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/L was concluded to be low ingeoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For the metabolite1,2,4 triazole this modelling indicated that this relevant metabolite will exceed the parametric drinkingwater limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/L in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwaterscenarios. The 80th percentile annual average recharge concentrations of 1,2,4-triazole leaving the top1m soil layer in the available simulations were predicted to be 0.14 - 0.89 \u00b5g/L for the representative uses assessed in cropping systems. Of course in situations when half the surface area of orchards orvineyards are treated the potential concentrations of 1,2,4-triazole in groundwater would be higherthan 0.89 \u00b5g/L. A data gap is identified for groundwater exposure assessments for multiple applicationpattern GAPs as well as for situations where at least half the surface area of an orchard or vineyard aretreated. In respect of just the parent amitrole it might be reasonably expected that when such anassessment is provided, concentrations would be indicated to be below 0.1 \u00b5g/L. For the representativeuse on permeable surfaces (railways), PEC were calculated using the model HardSPEC 1.4.2 (Hollis etal, 2003). This model was developed for UK geoclimatic conditions and reflects UK civil engineeringspecifications. Its applicability to other territories in the EU is not known. Using this UK modelconcentrations were calculated to be below the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/L for bothamitrole and 1,2,4-triazole.The available reliable PEC in soil, surface water, sediment, and groundwater covering a portion of therepresentative uses assessed can be found in Appendix A of this conclusion. Note data gaps areidentified for some PEC as discussed above (see also section 7).",

    "input": "4. Environmental fate and behaviour Fate and behaviour in the environment was discussed in the meeting of experts PRAPeR 42 (March \u2013April 2008), on basis of the DAR (August 2006) and the Addendum 1 (March 2008). A newAddendum 3 (May 2008) has been made available after the meeting of experts.4.1. FATE AND BEHAVIOUR IN SOIL4.1.1. ROUTE OF DEGRADATION IN SOILStudies were only performed with aclonifen labelled at the aniline ring. The potential metabolitesarising from the phenyl ring as a result of cleavage of the diphenyl ether linkage would be phenol andhydroquinone, both of which are naturally occurring in the environment. The relevance of thesepotential metabolites was not considered either in the DAR or in the peer review. Phenol is classifiedas toxic and may deserve further consideration in case amounts significantly above the naturalbackground level would be produced due to the use of aclonifen. The slow rate of degradation ofaclonifen in soil may prevent the build up of these metabolites in most of the situations. However,further data may still be needed by MSs to finalize the risk assessment at national level.The route of degradation in soil under dark aerobic conditions was investigated in two studies in atotal of five soils (pH 6.5 \u2013 7.3, OC 1.1 \u2013 1.9 %, clay 5.4 \u2013 24.5 %). The actual pH was notdetermined on the soils but based on historical records for the first study (three soils). The range ofpH in the soils investigated was too narrow with respect of naturally occurring pH\u2019s. However, the meeting of experts agreed that the data submitted was enough to satisfy the regulatory requirementstaking into account the wider pH range investigated when field studies are considered (pH 5.9-8.2).In the first study, some experiments were performed with soil moisture of 60 % FC and others with30 % FC. Also an experiment was performed at concentrations ten times lower than intended.Practically the totality of the extracted radioactivity consisted in parent compound with only veryminor metabolites detected. In this study, extraction method changed after DAT 7 from a harsh one(soxhlet) to a milder one (room temperature). The meeting of experts criticized this procedure as notfollowing good study design and practice. In relation with the parent compound, the argumentationpresented by the applicant based on the recoveries obtained in the sterile soil experiments, where softextraction was used for all data points, was accepted by the meeting as an indication that extraction ofparent is expected to have been efficient enough in the samples extracted with this method. There ispotentially greater uncertainty in the extraction efficiency for breakdown products, as the breakdownproducts were not present in the sterile experiments. However, the meeting accepted that majormetabolic fraction M1 was the origin of the chromatographic distribution and likely to be associatedwith soil colloidal components.Mineralization was negligible or very low (CO2: 0.7 \u2013 5.2 % AR). Unextracted soil residue increasecontinuously up to 42.5 \u2013 57.6 % AR at the end of the study (118 DAT) in the experiments performedat the concentration intended to mimic the application rate proposed as representative (2.5 Kg / ha).However, in the experiments performed at lower concentrations (0.25 Kg / ha) or under drierconditions (30 % FC) amount of unextractable was only of 21.2 % AR and 7.2 % AR respectively atthe end of the study.In the second route study, application rate was about three times intended rate (10 mg/kg approx. 7.5kg/ha). The study was performed at 40 % MWHC and 22 \u00baC. Up to 19 \u2013 21 % AR was characterizedas extractable degradation products. The amount increase with more polar solvent and was separatedin various compounds < 5 % AR by sequential TLC. Since no fraction accounted for more than 5 %AR, no identification of metabolites was performed. Unextractable radioactivity accounted for amaximum of 40.9 \u2013 63.7 % AR. This unextractable fraction was not solubilised by 2N HCl or 12.5 NNaOH after 5 h reflux indicating that it is constituted by strongly bounded or incorporated residues.Mineralization was practically negligible in this study (max. CO2 = 3 % AR).According the photolysis in soil study available, photolysis may contribute slightly to the degradationof aclonifen in soil. No metabolite exceeded 5 % AR.Degradation of aclonifen in soil under anaerobic conditions was investigated in one of the studiespresented in the dossier. However, the meeting of experts found this study not acceptable due to thelow recoveries (67 % AR) and the uncertainty associated to potential volatile components. Therefore,the meeting identified a data gap that was not considered essential to finalize the risk assessment ofthe EU representative uses.4.1.2. PERSISTENCE OF THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND THEIR METABOLITES, DEGRADATION ORREACTION PRODUCTSThe rate of degradation of aclonifen was investigated in the studies already summarized in the routesection. An additional study (anonymous, 1982) was performed with unlabeled aclonifen in two soils(pH 6.0 \u2013 7.0, OC 1.06 \u2013 2.6 %, clay 14.5 \u2013 24.7 %). Degradation under dark aerobic conditions at 10\u00b0C was also investigated in a study with two soils (pH 6.8 \u2013 7.2, OC 1.16 \u2013 1.55 %, clay 9-23 %).Aclonifen may be considered moderate to high persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 \u00b0C(DT50 = 32.2 \u2013 134 d).Kinetics of all aerobic degradation data was re-evaluated with non linear regression to first orderkinetic and values obtained were normalized to 20 \u00b0C and pF2. The re-evaluation was presented bythe applicant to the RMS, who assessed and summarized it in addendum 1. However, the study reportwas not available in the updated dossier. Therefore, the meeting identified a formal data gap for theapplicant to incorporate this report (Hardy, I. and Patel, M. 2008) into the updated dossier.In the study anonymous (1982), nominal concentration at time 0 were considered for the kineticfitting of the data originally presented in the DAR. This was considered not adequate by the meetingof experts (moreover when analytical recoveries were available). In the addendum the fitting excludesDAT 0 and only 4 data points are used; one less than the minimum 5 data points required by FOCUS.However, the experts agreed to exceptionally maintain these values in the data set because removingthem has no impact on the calculated geometric mean. The meeting of experts agreed the end pointsproposed by the RMS in table 66. However, it was agreed that no dramatic impact would be expectedin the results of the FOCUS modelling performed with a slightly shorter geometric mean half life.Two field dissipation studies are available: one in Northern Europe (1 study in Germany, 4 sites) andthe other in Southern Europe (1 study in Spain and France, 1 site each). First order half lives between57 d \u2013 195 d were observed in these trials.Two soil accumulation trials were performed in Germany (pH 5.9 \u2013 6.1; OM 2.3 \u2013 3.3 %). In thesestudies no accumulation was observed and an estimated half life of 30 d was calculated. The meetingof experts found that the dissipation rates in these sites were fast compared to the longer valuesobtained in some of the field dissipation studies. Therefore, the experts concluded that theseexperiments cannot be used to exclude potential for accumulation of aclonifen in soil.Accumulated, PEC soil were calculated by the RMS and presented in addendum 1 based on the worstcase field half life, annual application of 2400 g/ha and no interception. Plateau steady state wascalculated after 10 yr over a mixing layer of 20 cm. Actual and TWA PEC S were calculated addingthe result of the annual application on a 5 cm mixing layer over the plateau. The calculation wasagreed by the experts in the meeting.4.1.3. MOBILITY IN SOIL OF THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND THEIR METABOLITES, DEGRADATIONOR REACTION PRODUCTSA batch adsorption / desorption study in three soils (pH 5.7 - 7.3; OC 1.1- 2.5 %; clay 3.8 - 17.9 %) isavailable for aclonifen. This substance may be considered practically immobile in soil (Koc = 5318 \u201310612). Since only three experimental values are available, the lowest value, instead of the mean, hasto be used in FOCUS modelling.Column leaching studies and aged column leaching studies are available and confirmed that thesubstance is not mobile. Also non extractable residue in soil resulted to be immobile.",

Environmental fate and behaviour Investigation of the route of degradation of 6-benzyladenine did not show any metabolite needingfurther consideration with respect to soil or groundwater contamination.

PEC soil were calculated withworst case field half-lives.6-benzyladenine may be considered to be medium to low mobile in soil on the basis of batchadsorption/desorption experiments.6-benzyladenine is stable to hydrolysis (pH 5, 7 and 9). Photolysis may contribute only slightly to thedegradation of 6-benzyladenine in water. Main metabolite resulting from aqueous photolysis identifiedas adenine. In water/sediment systems 6-benzyladenine is degraded relatively rapidly. Dissipationfrom the water phase is fast due to partitioning to the sediment. PECSW has been calculated withFOCUS SW models up to step 4 to consider the effect of mitigation from a 10 m no-spray buffer zone(FOCUS 2001).According to the FOCUS GW models available (using worst case input parameters), it is not expectedthat 6-benzyladenine will contaminate groundwater above the limit of 0.1\u00b5g/L when used accordingthe good agriculture practices proposed for the representative uses (FOCUS 2000, 2007).",

    "input": "4. Environmental fate and behaviour In soil laboratory incubations under aerobic conditions in the dark, asulam exhibits low persistence,forming only one major (>10% applied radioactivity (AR)) soil metabolite, sulfanilamide. The rate ofmineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 6.1-7.5 % AR after 120 days. Formations ofunextractable residues were a sink, accounting for 64-76 % AR after 120 days. Under anaerobicconditions or in the soil photolysis study, no novel metabolites were formed. Metabolite sulfanilamideexhibited moderate to medium persistence under aerobic conditions.Based on batch adsorption/desorption studies asulam exhibited very high mobility, while themetabolite sulfanilamide exhibited high to medium mobility in soil. The high mobility of asulam wasconfirmed by column leaching studies. Using 4 different soil columns, 91 \u2013 98 % AR (columnleaching study) or the majority of the measured 50 \u2013 77 % AR (aged column leaching study) wasattributed to asulam in the leachates. In a monitoring study in an extremely vulnerable area inDenmark, asulam and sulfanilamide were found above the concentration of 0.1\u00b5g/L (0.21 and 0.13\u00b5g/L, respectively) in groundwater samples. In a turf site in Florida (USA), asulam and sulfanilamidewere detected >1\u00b5g/L sporadically in groundwater wells. These detections were considered to be dueto illegal spot spraying of asulam, however in a sprayed sugarcane site, 8 \u00b5g/L asulam was found in agroundwater sample. In another monitoring study in Florida in areas of high use of asulam (reported asmuch greater than in the EU), traces (<1\u00b5g/L) of asulam were found in drinking water wells (in 10 wells out of 28), moreover concentrations >1\u00b5g/L was found in three wells. It is noted that a relativelyhigh limit of detection (LOD) was used by the analytical methods of this study.PECsoil (predicted environmental concentrations (PEC)) for asulam was calculated based on theworst-case laboratory DT50 . For the metabolite sulfanilamide, initial PECsoil value was calculatedbased on the initial PECsoil of asulam.Asulam is stable to hydrolysis, but quick degradation was observed in aqueous photolysis studies.Three major photo-degradation products were formed and identified as sulfanilic acid, AP formamideand MCAPAP carbamate.In laboratory incubations in aerobic natural sediment water systems, asulam was relatively persistent(SFO DT 50 66-79 days). Partition of asulam to the sediment was relatively slow and moderated. Nomajor metabolites were formed. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 3-14% AR, whileresidues not extracted from the sediment represented 56 - 58% AR at the end of the study.The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (PEC) were appropriately carried outusing the FOCUS approaches (FOCUS, 2001; FOCUS, 2007) up to step 4, for asulam andsulfanilamide. At FOCUS step 4 level, reduction of exposure from spray drift (calculated for 5 m no-spray zone) and assuming that 80% runoff reduction was achieved, were considered. However itshould be noted whilst runoff mitigation is included in the step 4 calculations available, the FOCUS(FOCUS, 2007) report acknowledges that for substances with K Foc < 2000 mL/g (i.e. asulam,sulfanilamide), the general applicability and effectiveness of runoff mitigation measures had been lessclearly demonstrated in the available scientific literature, than is the case for more strongly adsorbedcompounds. PEC values for surface water were moreover calculated for the three major aquatic photo-degradation products based on the initial PECsw of the parent asulam calculated at FOCUS step 3 and4 levels.The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS (2000)scenarios and models (PELMO 3.3.2 and PEARL 3.3.3). The potential for groundwater exposure fromthe representative uses by asulam or the soil metabolite sulfanilamide above the parametric drinkingwater limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by therelevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. It should be noted whilst the field data indicating potentialmobility discussed above showed levels in groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit, thepatterns of use and/or geoclimatic conditions were not pertinent for the representativeness beingassessed at the EU level.Asulam has a low potential for volatilization with an estimated atmospheric half-life shorter than 2days. Therefore, long-range transport through the atmosphere is not expected.",
